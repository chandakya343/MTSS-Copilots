Empowering Students Through Thoughtful
Assessment and Support 
Guiding Students Toward Success with Compassionate Evaluation
and Strengthening Care
Empowering students to reach their full potential requires a comprehensive approach that
encompasses thoughtful assessment and support. You will now explore best practices for
assessing student mental health needs and strengths. By conducting thorough needs
assessments, educators can gain a deep understanding of students' unique challenges and
strengths, paving the way for tailored interventions. Additionally, it is essential to regularly
evaluate and reassess programs and initiatives to ensure their effectiveness. This section also
emphasizes the importance of sunsetting programs that are no longer serving their intended
purpose, making room for innovative approaches. Let’s get started! 
Best Practices for Assessing Student Mental Health Needs
and Strengths
So far, you have reviewed key assessment types, frequency, and participants in a schoolwide or
classroom needs assessment. You may be wondering about best practices in assessing student
mental health needs.  
Assessing student mental health strengths is a vital component of promoting overall wellbeing
and resilience among students. While identifying and addressing mental health challenges is
crucial, it is equally important to recognize and cultivate the strengths and positive attributes.
Knowing the strengths of students and staff as well as available resources will help you identify
the most effective and effcient improvement goals. 
You will now explore best practices for assessing student mental health needs and strengths. 
See the process plan outlined below for assessing
student mental health needs and strengths.

Needs Assessment Pre-Planning Activity   
Let’s put these best practices into action! You will now have the opportunity to conduct a mental
health needs assessment using the questions provided below. This will allow you to apply your
knowledge and skills in evaluating student mental health needs and strengths.
Review and answer the following questions as a guide
for conducting a mental health needs and strengths
assessment in your school.

It is important to note that these questions should be used as a guide and can be adapted based
on the speciﬁc context and needs of the students being assessed.  

Sunsetting Programs That Are Not Working
There may be times when assessment data reveal that existing programs or interventions are
ineffective or no longer working. This could be due to several reasons. For example, they may
not align with the speciﬁc needs of students, suffer from a lack of necessary resources, be
inﬂuenced by changing circumstances, rely on outdated strategies or approaches, lack ongoing
evaluation and monitoring, or lack stakeholder engagement. When assessment data reveal that
a program or intervention is ineffective, a thorough evaluation is necessary to identify the
reasons behind its ineffectiveness. This evaluation process can provide valuable insights for
making informed decisions about program adjustments, redesign, or the need for alternative
interventions that better meet the evolving needs of the students. 
In situations like these, review:
the evidence base for the program or intervention
staff buy-in and ﬁdelity with which it is delivered
the match (or mismatch) to your student or school needs
If any of these elements is missing or cannot be addressed, you should consider sunsetting (or
exiting) the program or intervention used in your school.
See a strategic abandonment assessment tool below (developed by the Ector County
Independent School District) to reﬂect on additional considerations for sunsetting a program
or intervention.

Let's review the lesson.
- In the school setting, there are numerous resources available to support mental
health, including school counselors, psychologists, mental health clinics, peer
support programs, crisis intervention teams, mental health awareness programs,
community partnerships, online resources, support groups, and initiatives
involving parents/guardians. 
- Resource mapping is the process of identifying resources. It is important as it
improves communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and access to the most
helpful programs and services, avoids duplicating services, minimizes confusion
and stress for service users, and helps maintain records of program or service
usage and outcomes. 
- The needs assessment process involves data collection and analysis to identify
prevalent mental health issues, risk factors, and protective factors. 
Needs assessment provides valuable insights into the needs and strengths of
students, enabling targeted interventions and support systems.

Data-informed Decision Making 
Taking Advantage of Data
Data sources on table
There is a great deal of data available for teachers, schools, and districts. Think about it! You
have grades, end of the year percentages, results from screeners, offce discipline, referrals—
and that’s not all! A large volume of data may be overwhelming, though, especially when trying
to make decisions.
It is common to feel lost about when to use data, which data to use, and how to make data-
informed decisions. 
In this lesson, the goal is to demystify data-informed decision making processes using the
MTSS framework.

What is Data-informed Decision Making?
Data-informed decision making is the process of using data to understand and meet needs. This
means analyzing the various sources of data that are available, looking for patterns, identifying
problems, and using this enhanced understanding to decide on what next steps will be most
beneﬁcial.  
Data can sound intimidating – however, data is just information. Decisions are made based on
data all the time in everyday life, even if you may not realize it. You may make a data-informed
decision when you: 
- Leave work at 6 PM because when you left at 5 PM yesterday, traffc made it take
twice as long to get home
- Eat at the restaurant that has a 5-star average review on Yelp instead of the
restaurant that has a 2-star average
- Purchase a car that has a higher miles-per-gallon rating to save money on gas
As you can see, data-informed decisions happen around
us all the time. Let's look at what this looks like in the
school setting.
Data collection is the ﬁrst step toward data-informed decision making. School systems
collect and maintain data for administrative, accountability, instructional, and support
service purposes.
Decisions that are informed by data in a structured and transparent process are more likely
to be effective, equitable, and effcient in supporting high quality student outcomes than are
other types of decision making.
Data-informed decision making processes can take a lot of time and thought, especially in
the early stages of data use. Persistence will pay off when you begin to see signiﬁcant positive
impacts on students’ academic, mental health, and overall wellbeing!
In MTSS, data is not about adding more to your plate. Instead, it is about ensuring that
you have the right nutrients on your plate when you need them.

Why Make Data-informed Decisions?
Now that we have more information about what data-informed decision making is, let's look at
how it is useful in the school setting. Let's start by reviewing this video about why data is so
important in the school setting. 
Why is data and data-based decision making such a critical part of……
Why is data and data-based decision making such a critical part of
As Dr. Little described in the video, data is a powerful tool used by teachers and other school
staff to identify student needs. Research demonstrates that data-informed decision making is
effective in improving student outcomes (Faria et al., 2017). 
Review the chart below for information on some of the
beneffts of data-informed decision making. 
- Providing information on student strengths –
Often, data is associated with looking for weaknesses or problems in the student population.
However, it is not just important to use data to identify students in need of support, but also to
learn about the unique strengths that students possess. 
- Reducing biases or inequities –
Using data to make decisions can provide objective measures to reduce any bias or inequity that
may exist. Data can also be used to determine when inequity is present.
- Making instructional time more efffcient –
Data can help teachers determine areas of strength and weakness in their classes and determine
which instructional methods may or may not be working for a particular group of students. This
can help them customize instruction as needed, adapting to the needs indicated by data.
- Increasing effectiveness of interventions –
Data can improve the effectiveness of interventions by ensuring that students are matched
appropriately and by measuring how well the intervention is going. With this knowledge,
practitioners can make decisions that increase their effectiveness and improve student
outcomes. 
- Providing students with the right fft when needed –
Ultimately, the goal of data-informed decision making is to ensure that students receive the right
support at the right time in order to meet their unique needs. Data gives us the information
needed to make these decisions.
What's my role?
Now that we know the power of data-informed
decisions, take a moment to consider how you
are (or could be) making these decisions in your
role.
There are many ways that you may participate in your school's process of data-informed
decision making. Here's a short list to get you started, but there are many, many others: 
- Use the scores from a pre-test given to your class to determine what to cover in the
next unit
- Use attendance records to determine which students in class are at-risk for falling
behind or dropping out
- Interpret universal screening results on an MTSS team
- Use progress monitoring to determine how an intervention is going
- Use behavior data (number of detentions, offce referrals, etc.) to determine if
students are in need of Tier 2 or Tier 3 support
- Keep going with this lesson for more examples and more information on this process!




Getting Started with Data-Informed Decision
Making
The First Step
The ffrst step in making decisions based on data is
ffnding data. Let's review some common sources of data
that you may have access to. 
Academic Assesments: Assessment data include universal screeners (e.g., Kindergarten
Readiness Assessment and reading screeners), progress monitoring
data, curriculum-based assessments, as well as grades and
daily assignments. 
Behavioral data: Behavioral data can come from behavioral assessments or
administrative sources such as offfce discipline referrals and visits
to the counselor, social worker, or nurse.
Attendance Records: Attendance data may be useful
in detecting barriers to student learning and success.
School Surveys: Survey data may be collected and available about students'
perceptions of the school climate, safety, and other topics
Community data: Community data include demographic characteristics such
as racial and ethnic composition, and community challenges such as
poverty, violent crime rates, prevalence of substance use
disorders, calls to crisis centers, and hospital visits
Social and emotional data: Social and Data from social, emotional, and
behavioral surveys and screeners are helpful for understanding
student risks and skills. More specialized mental health and
trauma screener data may be used as well.
These data sources may seem overwhelming. They can
also be broken down into categories: academic,
behavioral, and social-emotional. Review the graphic
below for examples.
IMAGE HERE
Graphic demonstrating different sources of data
With all of the information available, it's also important
to know what resources are available for collecting and
storing data. Below are examples of data collection and
interpretation structures. Click for more information.
Think about which of these you have access to and use in
your work.
Apps: Software for specific or special types of data analysis, reports, and communications
Spreadsheet Templates: Computer spreadsheet software for data entry set up to automatically make calculations or analyze data
Time: Protected time for data collection, analysis, and interpretation
Team Meetings: A space and time to interpret data
Community/Family Nights: A space and time to collect and/or interpret data
Social Media: Communication tool for collecting some types of data and sharing results
PowerSchool: Software to enter, retrieve, and analyze data
Shared Drives: Cloud drives or hard drives multiple team members can access
Take-home Folders: A system for sending home and bringing back data such as surveys

Utilizing Data: Progress Monitoring
Making Informed Decisions
Sources of data have been identiﬁed, so what's next? Let's review how to make the best use of
our data through progress monitoring. 
Progress monitoring is the process of setting goals and measuring their progress over time.
Progress monitoring can be used to support any type of academic, behavioral, or social-
emotional goals. There are three phases of progress monitoring that we will examine here.
Review the list below.
1. Goal setting
2. Visualizing progress
3. Measuring ﬁdelity

1. Goal Setting:
The ﬁrst step when monitoring progress is to determine what we are looking for. Using
baseline assessments can help inform what goals you want to set for your students and
determine what target outcome is being worked towards. 
No matter the target outcome, the team should take care to develop student goals that are
speciﬁc, measurable, and realistic for the student. You may have heard of SMARTIE goals. This
goal development technique has been applied to many behaviors, from workplace productivity
to ﬁtness to education. Using SMARTIE goals can help us be systematic with goal development
and, in turn, progress monitoring. 
Specific –
Your goal should be speciﬁc. Deﬁne the goal you are measuring in a clear, concise way. When
goals are related to behavior, use language that refers to the observable characteristics of the
behavior. For example, instead of setting the goal that “Julia will be less hyperactive,” be speciﬁc
about the behaviors Julia exhibits, such as tapping her pencil, getting out of her seat, and
wandering around the classroom. When forming a goal, also include any relevant information,
such as setting or time of day. A speciﬁc goal may be something like, "Julia will reduce her
pencil-tapping behavior in her classes." 
Measurable –
Be sure that you can measure the target behavior! This can get tricky with some internalizing
issues, like depression. One option is measuring symptoms with a standardized rating scale. You
could use something speciﬁc, like the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), or a general rating
scale, like the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-3). To continue our example with
Julia, we can measure the frequency with which she taps her pencil. We could add to our goal:
"Julia will reduce the amount of pencil-tapping behavior from 10 to 2 times per class." 
Achievable –
Goals should be challenging but attainable for students. We always want to set them up for
success. Goals can always be increased or adjusted if they are met quickly. This is a good problem
to have! 
Realistic –
Here, consider what is a reasonable amount of change for your time frame. Behavior issues are
rarely resolved quickly. Think progress over perfection. Maybe a student with social anxiety sat
on the edge of the carpet during her 3rd grade class's morning meeting. This could be an
improvement from sitting at her desk, away from the group. 
Timely –
Identify the time frame for achieving the goal. Include not only the projected achievement date,
but also how often progress will be monitored and by whom. Being clear about these details can
be helpful for intervention implementation, ﬁdelity, and timely data collection. For example, we
can set a speciﬁc timeline: "Julia will reduce her pencil-tapping behavior from 10 to 2 times per
science class by the end of this month." 
Inclusive –
When setting goals, think about inclusivity, or how we can bring marginalized people into our
decision making and procedure development. Consider not only your students, families, and
school staff, but the community at large.
Equitable –
Lastly, think about the fairness of your goal. What are some ways to incorporate restoration and
justice?

Review the flashcards below for some example goals you
may work with students to achieve. 
Attendance:Reduce number of absences, Reduce number of tardies or
early dismissals,Increase overall amount of time at school each day
Behavior: Reduce the amount of time between teacher's
instructions and when the child begins their work, Increase the amount of on-
task behavior during whole group instruction, Increase the amount of on-
task behavior
Anxiety: Increase school attendance, Increase use of calming
strategies during high-stress situations, Increase positive social
interactions with peers, Decrease escape behaviors (leaving the classroom)

Gathering Additional Information
To support these goals, you may need to gather additional information. Using anxiety as an
example, the team would likely need to gather additional information on what appears to trigger
anxiety at school. Are there certain times of day, settings, or other factors that seem related to
their experience of anxiety? How does anxiety look for this student? These are all important
questions to consider so the team can select an intervention that meets their needs. 
Using attendance as an example, we would likely need to support the entire family rather than
just the child. In addition, intervention for attendance would likely look different for an
elementary school child than a high school student who might drive themselves to school.

Visualizing Progress
After goals are set, the next step is to determine if the goal is being met and if progress is being
made. An effcient and practical way to detect district, school, group, or student progress is to
graph the data using a bar or line graph. This can show progress over time and be compared to
an intended goal line. Visuals help you quickly determine if you are meeting, exceeding, or
falling behind on goals.  
One way to describe students' progress is by using 3 categories: suffcient growth, uncertain
growth, and insuffcient growth. Let's take a look at what these categories mean.
Sufffcient Growth –
The graph in the picture demonstrates suffcient growth, meaning that the student is exceeding
their goal!
The student line (blue) is steeper and greater than the goal line (green). Steeper lines show that
desired growth has been achieved while participating in that intervention. 
In general, a student line should be a few (2 or 3) data points above the goal line to show that the
student has demonstrated consistently improved performance. This may be a good time to
reduce the intensity and frequency of support.
Uncertain Growth –
The graph in the picture demonstrates uncertain growth. 
The student line (blue) is wavering around the goal line (green). This may mean that you need to
take a closer look at the intervention/practices. 
At this point, check the frequency, ﬁdelity (the extent to which it is delivered as intended), and
intensity of the intervention. If the intervention is to meet with the school counselor weekly, it
could be that the student is missing these meetings—suggesting that the student is not actually
receiving treatment. 
You could also compare this student’s data to another student who is also receiving the same
treatment. If the other student is showing growth, the intervention may not work for this particular student.
Insufffcient Growth –
The graph in the picture demonstrates insuffcient growth. In this case, the student is still
improving; however, they are not growing at the rate that is hoped for. 
The student line (blue) is below the goal line (green). This may mean that the
intervention/practice is not working, and another intervention should be tried for the student. 
The next step is similar to uncertain growth. First, check if the intervention is being delivered
with ﬁdelity. If the intervention is delivered as intended, then it is now time to connect with the
MTSS team to review the student's data and develop a new support plan. 
For the new support plan, we recommend the following adjustments: 
- a focus on a different and/or more foundational skill 
- a change in the intervention strategy or program 
- a change in the time of the intervention sessions 
- a change in the interventionist 
- an increase in the intervention frequency 
Note: While these graphs indicate increases in desired outcomes, some graphs indicate
decreasing outcomes. For example, a student's goal may be to reduce offfce discipline
referrals each month. In these cases, the student line is still compared to the goal line;
however, it is hoped that the student is at or below the goal line instead of at or above the
goal line. Setting goals before progress monitoring lets you know exactly what to look for
in these graphs.

What do we do with this information?
If students are achieving suffcient growth, then that's great! Interventions can continue as
needed, and then decisions can be made to reduce interventions as ﬁt. However, if the team
reviews data and the student is not improving, there are several options. The team might decide
to discontinue or scale back the current intervention. Reviewing the data, the team might learn
that there are other prerequisite skills the student needs to work on rather than the original
target. For instance, if a student is not yet ready to participate in whole group instruction, the
team may decide to help the student build skills to remain in or near the group during
instruction. Alternatively, the team may ﬁnd another intervention that could be more effective
and decide to implement that instead.   
For more tips on progress monitoring for clinicians, we
hear from Dr. Ashley Greenwald, Director of the Nevada
PBIS Technical Assistance Center, in the video below.
As mentioned in the video, some goals may be challenging to monitor progress for, especially if
you are working on social or emotional goals that may not have as much observable data. For
students in small groups or individual interventions, clinicians' notes are a valuable source of
data. Don't forget to gather data on students' thoughts and feelings that are not as easily
observable!

Measuring Fidelity
When we hear progress monitoring, we tend to think of measuring students' progress. After all,
we are gathering data on students every day! We should also gather information to determine if
we are implementing programs, practices, and services as they were developed. You may have
heard of this referred to as intervention ﬁdelity. Before we can have conﬁdence in the
effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of a program or practice, we need to be conﬁdent about
ﬁdelity to that practice.
How do we measure intervention ffdelity?
This depends. If your intervention should include 3 sessions per week, and there are only one or
two sessions a week, there is clearly a problem with ﬁdelity. Keeping logs of sessions and
student attendance is one simple way to quickly check this type of ﬁdelity. If you're using a
manualized intervention, you would want to review your sessions to make sure you are
following all of the included steps. Some programs come with checklists. If not, making a
checklist for yourself can be helpful. Whatever interventions your school or district chooses,
there should be regular ﬁdelity checks. Your team can problem solve barriers to ﬁdelity early on
for the best results.
Brief measures can also be collected from families, teachers, and students. For Tier 3 services,
the Patient-Centered Outcomes Management System (PCOMS) is a brief measure that gathers
feedback from therapy clients and can identify issues or barriers to treatment success. You can
also use more informal measures, like quick electronic forms, to get a sense of how students,
families, and teachers think an intervention is going.
The Center on Multi-tiered System of Supports at the
American Institutes for Research (AIR) has additional
progress monitoring resources, including comparisons of
academic and behavioral screening tools and how teams
can use data to guide decision making. Click on the link
below to learn more!

Progress Monitoring
At the student level, progress monitoring is used to assess students'
performance, to quantify a student's rate of improvement or responsiveness to
instruction or intervention, and to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction
using valid and reliable measures. In addition, across all levels of the system
sites monitor progress to provide feedback for improvement.



Data-informed Decision Making and MTSS
IMAGE HERE
Connecting Principles to Systems
A graphic illustrating the components of data-informed decision making (adapted
from the Center on Multi-Tiered System of Supports)
The graphic above shows the three main components of data-informed decision making:
progress monitoring, screening, and a multi-level prevention system (like MTSS). As a practice,
data-informed decision making is a core element of MTSS and occurs across all three tiers. It is
central to identifying needs, connecting to appropriate services and instruction, and
monitoring progress toward goals.
MTSS is most effective when many types of data are examined collectively. This means looking
at academic, social, emotional, behavioral, administrative, and other survey data together to see
a more complete picture of your students, staff, school, and district. In this way, MTSS supports
all students as a whole. Let's review what this might look like at each tier of the system.

Tier 1
Universal (Tier 1) data is reviewed to support an entire school, classroom, or grade level. Class-
wide data, for example, helps teachers determine what types of instruction to offer all students.
Within the classroom, teachers may also struggle with students’ behavior, and universal
behavior supports such as schedules and routines may signiﬁcantly reduce the frequency and
intensity of challenging behaviors. Staff who review Tier 1 data with teachers can support them
with resources and strategies (e.g., coaching, professional development) to meet student
needs. 
In general, teams review Tier 1 data monthly to monitor the impact and effectiveness of Tier 1
evidence-based practices. Teams make adjustments if challenges are still present for most
students. If a Tier 1 practice or program is changed, looking at data before and after that change
is a great way to evaluate the success of that program or strategy. Always keep in mind ﬁdelity—
the extent to which a practice or program is being delivered as intended. If there are barriers to
program or practice ﬁdelity, these barriers must be addressed or another program or practice
selected.
If many or most students seem to need supplemental (Tier 2) support, it is likely introducing or
bolstering a high quality universal (Tier 1) program or practice will be enough to reduce
challenges and meet needs. Examining universal data early in the year and two additional times
during the school year and implementing high quality Tier 1 programming can prevent many
challenges for teachers, staff, and students.

Tier 2
Even when the evidence-based practices and programs are delivered with ﬁdelity and a high
degree of quality, there will still be some students who need additional support—this is when
supplemental (Tier 2) supports should be used. 
With Tier 1 practices in place, school teams should draft decision rules for identifying students
for supplemental (Tier 2) support. Data used as part of the identiﬁcation process may include: 
- Offce discipline referrals
- Suspensions
- Classroom minor behavior challenges
- Instructional time lost
- Academic performance
- Attendance and/or tardiness
The nature of the Tier 2 support should be matched with students' needs.
When developing intervention plans at Tier 2, it is essential to work with students’ strengths to
successfully meet needs.
For example, you may see from data that John is disturbing others and having diffculty
completing tasks. John also scored high on positive relationships. John may be able to
adapt/change his behaviors in the classroom with an approach where he is able to learn from
his peers, such as group work. 
Some districts use programs that aggregate student data and ffag students at risk for
academic or behavioral problems. These programs can give a helpful overview of the
student population of a school or district; at times, further examination of data or
information gathering may be required to understand the scope or depth of a student’s
issues. While these programs can be a useful resource, they do not take the place of
regular data reviews by the MTSS team.

Tier 3
With Tier 1 and Tier 2 support in place, a few students will continue to need more intensive
intervention—this is the Tier 3 intervention or intensive intervention. 
To identify if a student needs Tier 3 support, plan to look at multiple data points for individuals
(multiple points in time and multiple types of data). Tier 3 often requires an intensive data
review before making any decisions about intended interventions or evidence-based practices.
This intensive review is generally conducted by an interventionist or data team (NCII, 2013). 
Students who are referred or identiﬁed for Tier 3 support usually have already been provided
Tier 2 support. As with Tier 1 supports, consider if Tier 2 supports were delivered with ﬁdelity
and were a good match for the student's needs.
For Tier 3 support services, family input and involvement should be sought. Tier 3 services
should be multimodal, meaning that a therapist or interventionist would be providing
intervention, and classroom teachers (or others) would be providing additional supports across
the student's many environments. 
Make sure to let your students know that they can keep in contact with you even when
they move back to Tier 1! This may look like dropping by in the morning to say hello on
the way to class, or occasionally having lunch together at school.

Key Ways to Leverage Data Across All Tiers
Now that you have learned about data-informed
decision making at each tier, let's summarize some best
practices across all tiers! Click through the graphic
below.
Focus on different sources of data:
Validate your concerns with multiple sources of data. For example, examine attendance, discipline, and
depression screening data together.
Focus on the student as a whole:
Understand students' behavioral, social-emotional, and academic struggles and strengths in providing
the right support.
Let the data speak for itself:
Don't frame decisions based on assumptions and predictions. Comprehensively examine the data to guide
decisions. Look for or collect more data if you do not think you have enough information.
Understand the data:
Have a data code book that explains what each assessment measures. This way, others who are handling
the data are better equipped to make impactful decisions.
Know your students:
Knowing your students and understanding their experiences will help you better understand the reasons
behind a challenging behavior.
Analyze needs and strengths:
Observe the needs AND celebrate the successes and strengths!
Examine the underlying problem:
Do not rely only on students' symptoms for information. Work with your team to better understand what
is causing the problem. Generate multiple explanations and use data to guide you to the most likely cause.
Analyze data equitably:
Examine data by age, race, ethnicity, and other factors to make sure you fully address the needs of ALL
students.

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- Data is an extremely valuable tool in making decisions. Data is advantageous
because it can help make decisions less biased or inequitable, increase effciency of
classroom instruction/interventions, and identify both strengths and needs of
students. 
- Too much data can be exhausting and time consuming. Select and organize your
data sources to help make it more manageable. Some common data sources include
attendance and behavior records, academic assessments, grades, and test scores.
- Data is used to identify speciﬁc needs, connect to appropriate supports, and
monitor progress. The three main phases of progress monitoring include goal-
setting, visualizing progress, and measuring ﬁdelity. 
- Data-informed decisions are made across all three tiers of support to connect
students to support and make decisions about best practices.

Functioning
Outcomes:
1. Deﬁne and describe the importance of universal social, emotional, and behavioral
screening
2. Assess the process of implementing screening in the school setting
3. Consider examples of social, emotional, and behavioral screening tools


Universal Screening
Enhancing Awareness
You’ve heard universal screening mentioned through the previous lessons, but you may not be
as familiar with it as you want to be. Don’t worry! We’re going to go over it in much more detail
here. 
Universal screening is a systematic process of administering assessments to all students in a
school to identify students who may be at risk for certain negative outcomes or are in need of
additional support. This process is important because it identiﬁes concerns proactively and
helps students connect early with interventions and supports. For example, you may be familiar
with:
- Periodic Vision and Hearing Screening: All students are screened for vision and
hearing problems before entering school because of the impact of hearing and
vision problems on educational and social/emotional outcomes. When students are
identiﬁed through this process, they can be connected to vision and hearing
specialists for further testing and support. 
- Literacy Screening: Act 213 (provides direction on the implementation of South
Carolina MTSS and the use of approved screeners) requires that districts must
screen all kindergarten and 1st-grade students to determine their risk level in
reading. Like vision and hearing screening, the results of this can also help connect
students in need of additional support to literacy specialists and interventions.
- Kindergarten Readiness: South Carolina Code § 59-155-150 requires that students
entering publicly funded prekindergarten and kindergarten must be administered a
readiness assessment by the 45th day of the school year. 
- Other Academic Screening: There are other academic screening assessments, such
as MAP and CogAT. These assessments are used to identify learning needs and
customize instruction, such as identifying students for gifted and talented
programs.
Let's take a moment to watch this short video and
review the basics of universal screening in schools.
The Basics of Universal Screening
The Basics of Universal Screening
Let's recap what was in this video: 
- Screening is preventative and proactive: identifying student needs early can help students
connect to support before problems become larger 
- Screening can be applied to reading, math, and social-emotional-behavioral skills
In this lesson, we will focus on social-emotional-behavioral (SEB) screening. 
 “Awareness is the greatest agent for change.”   
- Eckhart Tolle, teacher and self-help author


What is Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Health Screening? 
The three critical and interrelated components of mental health are social - how we relate to
others, emotional - how we feel, and behavioral - how we act (Chafouleas, 2020). Universal
screening applied to social, emotional, and behavioral functioning can help identify students
with an elevated risk of having or developing a mental health disorder (e.g., Dvorsky et al., 2014).
Importantly, screening does not diagnose mental health disorders. Its purpose is to identify
students who may be at risk in order to provide further testing or connect to supports as
needed.  
To learn more about social-emotional-behavioral
screening, review the video featuring Kathleen Lane
below. 
Let's do a quick review of some of the main points of the above video:
Screening can indicate internalizing and externalizing concerns – internalizing concerns
can be more challenging to identify because of the lack of external behaviors that teachers
or other adults notice, so screening is important for catching these students
Screening happens in the fall (after school has started), winter, and spring
Screening can help identify which tier of support is needed for students: it could indicate
problems that may need to be addressed at the Tier 1 level, or indicate students or groups in
need of Tier 2 or Tier 3 intervention services 
Screening can help identify student strengths as well as needs

Screening Measures
Let’s review a little more about what SEB screening tools measure. As mentioned in the video,
SEB screening can indicate that some students may be at higher risk for developing mental
health disorders. These might be internalizing or externalizing. Let’s look at the difference
between the two.

Again, screening tools do not diagnose disorders. However, they can ﬂag students for further
testing and connect to support before concerns may become a disorder.  
Beyond this, we also know that good mental health is not simply the absence of risk, but the
possession of skills necessary to cope with transitions, changes, and everyday challenges.
Because mental health is not just the absence of risk, screening tools might also address
general social-emotional-behavioral competencies. Some of the skills they might test for
include: 
Self-Awareness:
Self-awareness involves understanding one's own emotions, personal goals, and values.
This includes accurately assessing one's strengths and limitations, having a positive
mindset, and possessing a well-grounded sense of self-effcacy and optimism. High levels
of self-awareness require the ability to recognize how thoughts, feelings, and actions are
interconnected.
Self-Management:
Self-management requires skills and attitudes that facilitate the ability to regulate one's own
emotions and behaviors. This includes the ability to delay gratiﬁcation, manage stress,
control impulses, and persevere through challenges in order to achieve personal and
educational goals.
Social Awareness:
Social awareness involves the ability to understand, empathize, and feel compassion for
those with different backgrounds or cultures. It also involves understanding social norms
for behavior and recognizing family, school, and community resources and supports.
Relationship Skills:
Relationship skills help students establish and maintain healthy and rewarding
relationships, and to act in accordance with social norms. These skills involve
communicating clearly, listening actively, cooperating, resisting inappropriate social
pressure, negotiating conﬂict constructively, and seeking help when it is needed.
Responsible Decision Making:
Responsible decision making involves learning how to make constructive choices about
personal behavior and social interactions across diverse settings. It requires the ability to
consider ethical standards, safety concerns, accurate behavioral norms for risky behaviors,
the health and wellbeing of self and others, and to make realistic evaluations of various
consequences of actions. 
Different screening tools will measure social, emotional, and behavioral health differently and
may focus on different aspects of the areas mentioned above. We will review some example
screening tools later in this lesson, so stay tuned for more information!

Why is Universal SEB Screening Important?
The U.S. Department of Education recognizes that universal screening is a critical ﬁrst step in
identifying students who are at risk for experiencing diffculties that threaten to impede the
learning process and impact their mental health and wellbeing. One of the key action steps
recommended is to use screening tools. In this section, let's examine why these screening tools
are so important.
Screening is extremely useful in the quest for overall student wellbeing. Screening can promote
social and emotional development for all students in classrooms by identifying those students
struggling with mental health challenges that impact their full access to and participation in
learning. SEB screenings in schools allow staff to:
- Proactively identify a signiﬁcant percentage of students that may be at risk for
social- emotional problems or mental illnesses
- Identify more details about those currently experiencing a range of mental health
concerns
- Identify those experiencing diffculties that have, thus far, gone undetected
- Decide when students may need additional services beyond Tier 1 (universal) into 
 Tier 2 (targeted) support and Tier 3 (intensive) support
- Determine if any school-wide trends are present that may need to be addressed at
the Tier 1 level
This early identiﬁcation of mental health concerns is extremely important. As you learned in
"All Hands on Deck," mental health challenges are a concern for many students: 1 in 6 children
is diagnosed with a mental health condition. In addition, approximately 50% of lifetime mental
health conditions begin by age 14 and 75% begin by age 24. At the same time, the average delay
between when symptoms ﬁrst appear and intervention is approximately 11 years (National
Alliance on Mental Illness, 2023).
When left untreated or undertreated, coping with the pain of mental illness can also contribute
to self-harm and thoughts of suicide, which is one of the leading causes of death for young
people ages 10-24 (Centers for Disease Control, 2020).  
Universal social, emotional, and behavioral health screenings in school allow for early
identiﬁcation, prevention, and connecting students with needed mental health services and
interventions. Here are some reasons why universal screening assessments are especially
helpful for identifying students who are at risk for developing mental illnesses: 
1. Youth do not generally seek help on their own. Young people are reluctant to seek
help for mental health problems (Chan & Quinn, 2012; Yap, et al., 2013) due to
stigma and/or inability to recognize there is a problem.
2. Adults are not always able to correctly identify youth who experience mental health
issues by observation only. It is often diffcult to correctly recognize mental health
issues in young people. Adults may not know what signs to look for and may not
understand how to encourage young people to seek help.
3. Reliable screening instruments are widely available. Schools and staff have access
to a full range of valid evidence-based screening instruments.
4. Help is available. Schools have access to programs offered by staff within the
schools along with external community partners who come to schools to offer
supports.

“Students come to school each day with more than their lunch and
backpack. They bring life factors that shape their learning and
development. These inffuences range from family issues, health
concerns, and culture...to behavior, learning proffles, and
abilities...all have the potential to impact the mental health of
students.”

Implementing Universal SEB Screening
Applying the Strategy
Now that we have more information on what universal SEB screening is, let's examine what this
looks like when being implemented in the school setting. 
Based on a review of approximately 35 publications on school‐based mental health screening,
mental health screening within an MTSS framework is occurring nationally in all grade levels
(National Center for School Mental Health, 2015). In fact, a recent internal survey conducted by
the School Superintendents Association indicated that “students’ behavioral health needs”
were the top concern of superintendents across the country (Jackson, 2018).
However, even though universal behavioral health screening in schools has been proven
effective, adoption of screening practices has been limited. Many schools continue to rely on
offce discipline referrals as a primary source for the identiﬁcation of students needing support.
Data from multiple studies indicate that, at most, only 20% of schools currently engage in
mental health screening (Herman et al.,2020). Review the list below for some common barriers
to implementing SEB screening. 
Awareness –
One barrier to implementing SEB screening may be that not all educators are aware that such
screening practices exist or may not know how to use them (Bruhn et al., 2014). 
Limited support –
Schools may be hesitant to implement SEB screenings because of a concern that it will identify a
larger number of youth in need of intervention than can readily and feasibly be served by a school
(Dever et al., 2012).
Time –
Many schools may have a substantial number of required screenings already in place, and adding
SEB screening may be a concern for time and resources. 
Community responses –
Educators may be concerned about negative reactions or hesitation from students' parents and
caregivers (Bruhn et al., 2014).
Limited training –
Educators may not have received enough guidance and training around how to carry out
screenings (Moffa et al., 2018). 

Planning for Implementation
Having a plan for screening can help address some of these concerns and break down some of
these barriers. Careful planning and preparation are key. To be initiated successfully, issues
related to the following factors must be addressed:
- Obtaining district, staff, student, and family cooperation: involved stakeholders should
consider the screener to be acceptable and useful   
- It must be practical to universally administer the screener within the desired context. This
includes clear instructions and examples to explain any diffcult concepts. 
- Allocating resources (ﬁscal and staffng) to support the screening process
	Training and professional development regarding screening (administration, data
	analyses, decision making, intervention selection, and rules related to decisions)  
	Deﬁning roles and responsibilities of all staff involved in the screening process 
- Addressing ethical, legal, and liability considerations (e.g., parental consent and student
assent; communication; conﬁdentiality) 
- Developing and expanding data systems 
- Identifying and coordinating resources necessary to support students in need of additional
intervention 
- Time
	Consider the amount of time needed to collect, store, enter, manage and analyze
	screener data, in addition to time for administration
	An additional consideration is time that personnel will need to train staff in the
	administration and completion of the screening process


Selecting Screening Tools
Once an initial plan for screening is in place, schools and districts can begin selecting the
screeners that are most appropriate for their needs. A wide variety of evidence-based screening
instruments have been developed and are available for use in schools, with each tool having its
own strengths and weaknesses. In this section of the lesson, we will discuss what to look for in
a screening tool. Overall, primary considerations should be whether the evidence-based
instrument provides the appropriate information that the school desires and whether the
instrument is a "good ﬁt” for the school. 
For more information determining if screening tools are
a good fft for your school, review the video below from
the Comprehensive Integrated Three-Tiered Model of
Prevention, featuring Dr. Kathleen Lane. 
Concluding Thoughts on Screening
Concluding Thoughts on Screening
To summarize Dr. Lane's main points: 
- The question is not if you screen, but which tool to use 
- There are four recommendations for implementing screening effectively:  
	Build expertise – know how to use screening tools and provide training for anyone
	administering them
	Develop structures for improving practices 
	Conduct screening responsibly - apply research, use Technical Assistance centers,
	and seek input and feedback
	Consider legal implications – know state laws 
- Some questions to consider when you are selecting screeners are: age/grade level, who
completes the screener, types of concerns assessed, cost, time, is intervention included?
- Have a plan – know what you are going to do with screening data, and be careful not to
overwhelm the system
- The best screening tool is the one that best meets the needs of your individual school
Let's examine two of these points in more detail: 1) using screening responsibly, and 2)
matching screeners to needs.

Using Screeners Responsibly
As mentioned in the video, it is important to use tools that are backed by research and have
evidence for their effectiveness. Validity, reliability, classiﬁcation accuracy, statistical bias, and
sample representativeness are all important indicators of the effectiveness of a screening tool.
Review the ﬂashcards below to learn more about what these terms mean.
Validity: Validity refers to how well the measure indicates what it intends
to. For example: does the screener accurately identify students who
have behavioral challenges?
Reliability: Reliability is an indicator of the consistency of the measure. For
example, does the screener show the same results when repeated?
Classiffcation accuracy : Classiffcation accuracy refers to whether or not the measure is
accurate in its results, or if there are false negatives (identifying
students as not being at risk even though they are) or false positives
(identifying students as at-risk when they aren't).
Statistical bias: Statistical bias refers to how well the measure works for
different student groups. It is important for screening tools to work equally well across all
student groups, so if there is any disproportionality indicated by the screener, other
assessment tools may be needed or modifications may be needed. 
Sample representativeness: Sample representativeness refers to whether or not the measure is
used for the population that it was designed for. For example, a screening tool might be based on a
national sample or based on a speciffc state. 
The National Center on Intensive Intervention at the
American Institute of Research provides ffve one-page
documents with a brief overview of each of these areas.

Matching Screeners to Needs
Once tools that are evidence-based have been identiﬁed, the next step is to determine which of
these tools will work best for your speciﬁc school or district. One question to ask to help
determine the right ﬁt for a screening tool is what purpose the screening is intended to have in
the school. While the general purpose of universal screening is well-deﬁned, school teams need
to come to a consensus about the purpose of screening in their school building. Having a clear
purpose can help teams reach their desired outcomes. 
Review the image below for a list of questions to ask about the purpose of a screening tool. Click
to enlarge.

Graphic of four questions to determine the purpose of a screening tool
Once the purpose of screening has been identiﬁed, it is also important to consider the usability
and feasibility of the measure as well as its contextual appropriateness. Review the cards below
for more information about these aspects of screening tools.

Usability and Feasibility:
Usability and feasibility are important considerations in determining ﬁt. Some questions to
ask include: 
	-Can the data be collected, analyzed, interpreted, and used within the constraints of the
	educational environment?
	-Is the data accessible and understandable?

Contextual Appropriateness:
Different screening tools are designed for different groups of students. When selecting a
screening tool, it is important to consider the context that it was designed for. Questions to
ask about contextual appropriateness include:
	- What ages/grades is the measure intended for?
	- What language is the measure available in? Is it accessible for English Language
	Learners? 
	- Does the screening tool function similarly across different student subgroups?
	- What are the similarities and differences between your student population and the
	population used as the "norm" group (the group used to research and develop the
	screener you will be using)?
Answering these questions can ensure that the screening tool is the right ﬁt for your student
population.


The list below describes some common traits of strong
screening tools (O'Malley, 2020).
- Low cost
- Low time demand
- Psychometrically sound
- Assesses key domains and links to an MTSS Framework
- Easy to access, collect, and interpret data
While these traits are generally beneﬁcial in a screening tool, as mentioned earlier, the most
important aspect of selecting screening tools is that they are a good ﬁt for your speciﬁc
community. For more information about speciﬁc screening tools that are available and meet
these criteria, keep going with this lesson!




Survey of Screening Tools
What is Available?
Now that we know more about what screening tools are, why they are useful, and some
considerations for implementing them, let's review some examples of screening tools that are
currently available. There are many more screening tools than we will review here, so there are
many options!

The Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD)
The SSBD is an evidence-based screening system for identifying students who are at risk for
internalizing and externalizing problems. These two forms of behavioral problems can disrupt
social adjustment and impair academic success. SSBD provides the means to quickly identify
these students and enables school staff to implement early interventions and supports. Click the
play button to watch.


The Student Risk Screening Scale - Internalizing and
Externalizing (SRSS)
The SRSS-IE (Drummond, 1994; Lane & Menzies, 2009) is a universal screening tool used three
times per year to identify students who may be at risk for challenging, antisocial behavior. The
SRSS-IE is conducted to better inform instruction. It is not used to exclude students from the
instructional environment. Rather, it is used to select appropriate support for students. The
SRSS is not used independently to determine special education eligibility or make other high-
stakes decisions. The SRSS-IE, like all universal screening tools, is not used to label students.
The SRSS-IE is not intended as an assessment of traits or personality. It should be used as one
of multiple data sources to indicate student risk. 

Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System
(BIMAS-2)
The Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System (BIMAS-2™) is a measure of
behavioral functioning and social, emotional skills in children and adolescents ages pre-k to 18
years. 
The BIMAS 2- can:
- Identify children who are at risk with an early warning system
- Monitor the effectiveness of system-wide interventions like Positive Behavior Supports,
(PBS), or Social Emotional Learning, (SEL)
- Monitor small group or individual intervention plans
- Analyze common behavioral concerns and adaptive behavior
For more information, review the link below.

The Strengths and Difffculties Questionnaire
The Strengths and Diffculties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief, 25-item measure of behavioral
and emotional diffculties that can be used to assess mental health problems in children and
young people aged 4–17 years. The SDQ can capture the perspective of the child/young person
(self-report) or the observations of parents and teachers.
The SDQ can be used as a screening tool or to measure treatment outcomes, and it has been
extensively implemented across countries for research and clinical purposes. It is available in
over 40 different languages and can be used without charge for non-commercial purposes.
Review the link below for more information and downloads of multiple versions of the
assessment. 
A) 25 items on psychological attributes. All versions of the SDQ ask about 25
attributes, some positive and others negative.

The Social, Academic, & Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS) 
The Social, Academic, & Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS) is a brief tool supported by
research for use in universal screening for behavioral and emotional risk. The measure falls
within a broad class of highly effcient tools and is suitable for teacher use in evaluating and
rating all students on common behavioral criteria (Severson, et al., 2007). The SAEBRS is
designed for use in the K-12 setting. It is grounded within a conceptual model, which states that
a student’s success in school is not only related to his or her academic achievement, but also to
success within multiple behavioral domains.
Follow the link below for more information. 

FastBridge SAEBRS
Social Behavior Domain (6 items) Students' ability to understand social norms,
empathize, and understand the perspectives of others. Academic Behavior
Domain (6 items) Skills necessary for students to be prepared for, participate
in, and beneﬁt from academic instruction. Emotional Behavior Domain (7
items) Students' ability to regulate internal states, adapt to change, and
respond to stressful/challenging events.

WCSD's Social and Emotional Competency Assessment 
The WCSD Social and Emotional Competency Assessment (SECA) is a set of instruments
developed through a collaboration between Washoe County School District in Nevada, the
Collaborative for Academic and Social Emotional Learning (CASEL), and the University of Illinois
at Chicago through an Institute of Education Sciences Research-Practitioner Partnership grant.
The project resulted in the development of two instruments and a bank of items aligned to the
CASEL 5 clusters and WCSD SEL standards. 
Long-Form Assessment: 40-item instrument measuring eight domains of social and emotional
competence: 
- self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses 
- self-awareness of emotions 
- self-management of emotions 
- self-management of goals
- self-management of schoolwork
- relationship skills 
- social awareness
- responsible decision-making
Short-Form Assessment: 17-item, short-form assessment of global social and emotional
competence.  
Item Bank: 138 items assessing eight domains. Useful for training and item replacement.

All three instruments are free and open-source. You and your organization can use and adapt the
instruments any way you would like. You do not need to request permission to use these
instruments, but it is appreciated if you would cite the measure to track how organizations use
the instruments, expand the knowledge base, and connect users together. The measure can be
cited as “items from or adapted from the WCSD Social and Emotional Competency Assessment
(Davidson et al., 2017).” Review the link below for more information.
