Tip 5
Employ Other Strategies to Gather Input
Teams may also choose to engage with stakeholders through focus groups, surveys,
interviews, or other methods appropriate to their context and needs.
Tip 6
Maintain Ongoing, Two-Way Communication
Stakeholder input should not end once a plan is written. Include stakeholders in the
vision-setting process. Identify ongoing opportunities to share information about
MTSS with the school community, and to receive formative feedback from your key
stakeholders as implementation progresses.

All Done!
Now that you have a better picture of who is on the DCLT, it’s time to examine the function of
the DCLT! 

How Does the DCLT Work With MTSS?
District administrators have a process to identify organizational readiness for implementing or
improving MTSS and/or integrating mental and behavioral health support into an existing
academic, tiered system. To ensure implementation, this process begins with an overarching
commitment to a strong and effective MTSS, clarity about the current status, and establishing a
focused mission.  
Work within the district team is focused on these 3 critical organizational needs (National
Association of State Directors of Special Education Blueprint, 2008):  
- Consensus: First, MTSS concepts are communicated to those who will be
implementing practices. This is where the “whys” are discussed and embraced.
Districts must then arrive at consensus regarding the importance of adopting and
integrating the MTSS framework and commit to the principles and practices that
guide implementation.  
- Infrastructure: Districts and their schools assess their existing practices/policies
against the essential components of MTSS, identify practices that are working well
and align with the framework, and address identiﬁed practice gaps. Infrastructure-
building focuses on closing these practice gaps.  
- Implementation: Structures and support are put in place to implement and
formalize MTSS practices with sustainability as the key consideration.
Now that there’s a foundation of who is on the DCLT and how the DCLT interacts with MTSS,
let’s move on to look at the speciﬁc functions of the DCLT. Before that, take a few moments to
reﬂect on the following questions:   
What leadership teams exist in your school district?
Are there other community organizations, state agencies, or
champions that could be added?
Are roles and responsibilities clearly deﬁned and in alignment
with a shared mission?
These questions allow you to assess the existing leadership teams and their collaboration
mechanisms in supporting student success. Considering the potential involvement of other
community organizations, state agencies, or champions can uncover untapped resources and
opportunities for strengthening your MTSS efforts. Evaluating the clarity and alignment of roles
and responsibilities among team members is crucial in fostering a cohesive and uniﬁed
approach, ensuring that everyone is actively working towards the shared mission of promoting
student success through MTSS. By engaging in this reﬂective process, you can identify areas for
improvement, enhance collaboration, and optimize the effectiveness of your MTSS team
leadership. 


What Are the Core Functions of the DCLT?
While each district has differences in the makeup of the leadership team, the primary functions
of the DCLT are often similar when the decision is made to adopt a comprehensive multi-tiered
framework. Let's look at a breakdown of district team responsibilities. 
In other words, let's look at what tools the DCLT offers in the roadmap creation process!
Stakeholder Support –
The DCLT creates opportunities for each partner to share their perspectives and knowledge on
academic, behavioral, and mental health needs and priorities, and to develop potential action
steps to advance the MTSS. The strength of the DCLT lies in strong, positive, and ongoing
collaborative partnerships.  
District leaders reach consensus and continuously advocate for policy change and funding
opportunities that can promote high-quality and sustainable school behavioral health. By
frequently communicating outcomes with stakeholders and celebrating successes (for example,
sharing innovative approaches to service provisions) the DCLT works to inﬂuence more
supportive policies and increases needed funding.  
When the DCLT can "communicate a clear, common vision and belief for intervention which
expresses a movement from compliance to commitment to the process as well as awareness and
support for resources needed to successfully implement and continue the use of interventions," it
builds a commitment in the community (SCMTSS, Framework, and Guidance Document, 2019). 

MTSS Alignment –
To ensure MTSS alignment across the district, the DCLT may set school team expectations for
interventions, data collection, and evaluation methods that assess and address student needs at
whole-school, small group and individual levels. 
The team guides and supports schools as they partner with families and community
organizations to integrate mental health services into the MTSS. The DCLT efforts promote
consistency across these contexts and areas of support for programming to be successful. 

Building and Strengthening Workforce Capacity –
The DCLT makes sure the system has the workforce necessary to implement and sustain the
MTSS by: 
- enhancing the existing workforce 
- expanding or clarifying roles and functions 
- investing in the schools’ infrastructure with support where/when needed 
- augmenting the existing resources and services available to ensure the work gets done 

Provide and Promote Professional Development –
The DCLT coordinates professional development so that all staff members are using common
MTSS language and strategies to support student academics and behavioral health and well-
being and provides additional instruction for educators and practitioners of students with more
intense needs.  
The district team will provide ongoing data-informed professional development activities that
align with core student goals and staff needs.  
Districts can develop standardized training for schools, encourage and advocate for access to
appropriate technology and its use, and provide ongoing technical assistance and resources. 
The DCLT provides overall funding and support for staff training including speciﬁc training in
school mental health topics and interventions. (SCMTSS, Framework, and Guidance Document
2019).

Coaching Support –
The DCLT utilizes systems coaching, a dynamic, supportive process to facilitate and assist the
district teams to build capacity to implement MTSS in alignment with district improvement
plans to enhance student academic and behavioral health outcomes. 
Click here for a "Systems Coaching and Leadership" fact sheet.

Evaluation, Feedback and Problem Solving –
The DCLT is responsible for decisions such as procedures for the evaluation of implementation
and outcomes. DCLT provides ongoing problem solving to support an effcient and effective
system. The team is responsible for regularly analyzing program information and making data-
informed decisions with a focus on continual improvement. 

What now?
The DCLT is in place with stakeholders identiﬁed and invited, and what the DCLT does when it is
fully functioning is established, so what happens next?   
You'll hear more about the difference between "engagement" and "inclusion" in the lesson,
"School-Family-Community Partnerships." For now, just know that the goal with engagement
is moving towards working "with" teammates and not "for" them. Engagement underscores
authentic partnerships with organizations, agencies, and nonproﬁt groups within the DCLT. 
All valuable collaboration starts with meaningful relationships. Building and strengthening
relationships begins with the coordination of teaming efforts. Creating a welcoming and
organized environment for community partners is critical for sustainability and progress
toward goal attainment.   
Let's watch the next video featuring Andrea Peyton, a
community health director and DCLT member, sharing
her experience and tips. 
As Andrea Peyton said, being a partner is a journey, not something that just happens. Take a
moment to download and review the DCLT Early Decisions Checklist below. This will help you
ﬁnd the guideposts of progress when creating or participating in a DCLT! 

Where are you in the Process?
In the very ﬁrst lesson, you reviewed the four stages of MTSS implementation: exploration,
planning, initial implementation, and full implementation. No matter where your school or
district is starting from, there is an implementation entry point—even better, there are
resources to help you ﬁnd it! 
Let's hear Ashley Greenwald, an assistant professor and Board Certiﬁed Behavior Analyst,
discuss the Initiative Inventory Tool, a free resource available to assist district teams exploring
MTSS in the video below!
Ashely describes the Initiative Inventory as “wildly helpful” because it helps schools
understand each different initiative and intervention, how it needs to be implemented, and how
it can be monitored. This is a great tool if you don’t know what your DCLT’s entry point into
MTSS implementation is! 
You have a good picture of team-based leadership and district-level responsibility to create the
framework and supports for schools in the implementation of MTSS. Now, let's explore
leadership teaming within the school buildings. First, a knowledge check!




The School Level
Fostering a Culture of Collaboration and Teamwork by Providing
Opportunities for Educators to Share Ideas, Strategies, and Resources
School level MTSS teams promote school-wide competence of multi-tiered practices and
interventions. Here, the roadmap is actually being created. To create a roadmap for MTSS,
school teams must examine a school's capacity and readiness, develop plans, create structure
and process, and conduct ongoing evaluation and review of efforts, with active involvement of
families and community partners in the work. 
This is the point at which a theory or idea is put into practice. The roadmap is actually being
created and then used. For the MTSS framework, the school-building is where it all happens.
The lion’s share of the MTSS work is carried out at the school level, but more importantly, it is
most impactful at the school level. The school team is the voice of the building to the district.
Let’s look at the roles and responsibilities of that team in greater detail now!

Roles & Responsibilities: School Leadership Team
Members of the teams should function with a shared vision for facilitating the MTSS. The
members should be representative of the school and community and lead implementation
efforts, including administrators, families, and school personnel who are skilled and
understand the multidisciplinary needs of the whole child— academic, behavioral, and positive
health and wellbeing. Click through the tabs below to read more about their roles and
responsibilities. 


School Building Team Members, Roles, and Responsibilities
The MTSS teams include administrators, families, and school personnel who are
skilled and understand the multidisciplinary needs of the whole child— academic,
behavioral, social, and emotional. Click through the MTSS team members to read
more about their roles and responsibilities.
Example Roles and Responsibilities # 1
School Administrators
The principal ensures there is an MTSS team to design the school-wide
implementation process, progress monitoring protocols, and data collection
procedures. They also conduct frequent systematic data conversations with team
members.  
The principal: 
- oversees MTSS implementation in the building  
- makes sure there is a time during the day for staff to attend MTSS team meetings  
- ensures that the meetings occur regularly, and all relevant personnel are in attendance 
- attends MTSS meetings and/or selects MTSS administrator designee to 
		a. examine data and instructional practices at the Universal/Tier 1 level  
		b. facilitate problem-solving using school-wide data to guide instructional decisions 
		c. monitor ﬁdelity of instruction and intervention implementation at Tier 2 and Tier 3 
		d. communicate with DCLT, families, and the community 
- ensure that faculty and staff have access to relevant professional development
and technical assistance related to MTSS implementation 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 2
School Counselors
As a primary resource for administrators, teachers, and parents regarding mental
health awareness, school counselors implement school counseling programs
addressing the needs of all students. School counselors deliver instruction, appraisal,
and advisement to students in all tiers and collaborate with other specialized
instructional and intervention personnel, educators, and families to ensure
appropriate academic and behavioral supports for students within the school’s MTSS
framework. 
According to the American School Counselor Association, school counselors align
with the school’s MTSS by:
- providing all students with standards-based school counseling instruction to
address universal academic, career, and social/emotional development and
analyzing academic, career, and social/emotional development data to identify
students who need support
- identifying and collaborating on research-based intervention strategies
implemented by school staff
- evaluating academic and behavioral progress after interventions
- revising interventions as appropriate
- referring to school and community services as appropriate
- collaborating with administrators, teachers, other school professionals, 
 community agencies, and families in MTSS design and implementation 
- advocating for equitable education for all students and working to remove
systemic barriers

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 3
Teachers and Instructional Staff
Within the MTSS, all instructional staff: 
- provide high-quality standard-based instruction and interventions with ﬁdelity  
- implement selected schoolwide evidenced-based practices with ﬁdelity  
- collect data on the effectiveness of Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 interventions
(progress monitoring)  
- collaborate in problem-solving efforts to determine interventions and supports  
- implement strategies, support, and plans for small group and individual students
- ensure that appropriate data are provided to request assistance for students and
to use in problem-solving meetings  
 
continuously engage and inform parents of student progress 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 4
School Psychologists
School psychologists play an integral role in promoting and supporting competency
development within the core components of MTSS, including data-informed decision
making, evidence-based interventions, implementation ﬁdelity, and consultation
and collaboration (National Association of School Psychologists, 2020). In MTSS,
data-informed decision making includes universal screening of all students,
implementation of evidenced-based interventions at multiple tiers, and ongoing
progress monitoring to inform the decisions at each tier. A problem-solving process
supports ongoing evaluation of the data in order to make timely and ongoing
informed decisions (Gresham, 2007).  
School psychologists 
- attend DCLT and MTSS school leadership team meetings 
- contribute expertise in data interpretation and analysis, progress monitoring,
and effective problem-solving.  
- administer diagnostic screening assessments assist in observing students in the
- instructional environment assist in designing interventions matched to student
needs, based on data  
- assist with the identiﬁcation of appropriate interventions and progress
monitoring  
- consult with the school-based leadership team and school staff regarding MTSS
needs 
- provide consultation and support to the school throughout the problem-solving
phases 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 5
Community Mental Health Clinician
The school mental health clinician is a key member of both the MTSS team and the
school culture. Their visibility and voice on this team and throughout the building
communicates the importance of mental health across all tiers of the MTSS.  They
function as not only a referral source for students and families with more intensive
needs, but also as a consultant for wellness efforts across the tiers.   
School mental health clinicians: 
- attend all MTSS meetings 
-cprepare and report on qualitative and quantitative progress data on students and
families receiving intensive support 
- facilitate problem solving, offering key insights on the impacts and potential
root causes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors 
- identify and collaborate on research-based intervention strategies implemented
by school staff 
- support problem-solving and mediation for educators 
- lead and plan professional development related to individual and systems level
mental health and wellness strategies  
- facilitate small groups related to prevention, intervention, and postvention
support 
- continuously interact with and engage families at both the community and
individual level 
A barrier that is often encountered by clinicians in the school setting is lack of a sense
of belonging. For clinicians to be an effective teaming resource and not just a referral
source, there must be intentional effort to both educate them on the language of
education and the MTSS framework, while integrating them into the broader school-
wide community.   

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 6
Families
Parents and caregivers play a critical role in supporting what their children are
learning in school. Families and caregivers have valuable insights and information
about their children's strengths, needs, and preferences. They can provide critical
information to the MTSS teams about the student's background, interests, learning
styles, and any concerns they may have. This information helps the team create a
more comprehensive support plan.   
For children in Tier 2 and Tier 3 level supports, families should be involved in decision
making by being informed of academic, social, emotional, or behavioral areas that
may need to be addressed. Families should also be informed about how the child’s
progress will be monitored.  
Families can be involved in the MTSS process by communicating any concerns to the
child's teacher, providing insight into their child's learning and development, and
assisting with identiﬁed interventions at home. To participate, parents and caregivers
should have a clear understanding of the MTSS framework. To help families
understand what MTSS is and how it functions, it’s important to explain terms that
may be common to the school but unfamiliar in the home. Here are a few examples:
- Intervention: Consistent, systematic teaching and involvement with a student in
order to improve his or her performance academically, socially, or emotionally.  
- Intervention Plan: The components include an objective, what will be done, who
will do it, how it will be done, when it will be done, when it will be reviewed, who
will review it, and what will happen if the student makes or does not make
adequate progress.  
- Scientiﬁc, Research-Based Instruction: Curriculum and educational
interventions that are research-based and have been proven to be effective for
most students.  
- Universal Screening: A step taken by school personnel three times a year (i.e.,
fall, winter, spring) to determine which students are having diffculties that may
interfere with grasping grade-level instruction, and which students may be
exceeding grade-level. Students whose scores on the screening fall below or
above a certain cutoff point are identiﬁed as needing continued progress
monitoring and possibly more intensive interventions.  
- Progress Monitoring: A scientiﬁcally based practice used to assess students’
academic performance and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction. Progress
monitoring can be implemented with individual students, small groups, or an
entire class.  
- Problem-Solving/Leadership Team: A school-based team that meets regularly
to analyze student data, and to identify student learning and behavior needs in
order to develop interventions. The team, along with the caregivers, make
decisions to determine what intervention may be most appropriate for the
student to make progress.  
Data-Informed Decision Making: The use of data to guide the design,
implementation, and adjustment of instruction. 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 7
Responsibilities of the School Leadership Team
To promote a healthy school climate, the school leadership team, like any leadership
team, should reﬂect the diversity of the staff, students, and broader community. In
addition, the team members should bring a diversity of skills and expertise to best ﬁll
out the responsibilities of different roles.

All Done!
Here is an example of a school district-developed MTSS team list including members, roles, and
responsibilities from Broward County Public Schools in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Download the
PDF below!
BC MTSS Team examples.pdf
Phew! That’s a lot of roles and responsibilities. It can feel very overwhelming, especially if
you’re unsure of where your school currently sits with teams or if you feel overrun by teams in
your school already! Let’s look at this in more depth. 


School Team and Sub-team Structure
Many schools have team structures in place already, often curriculum and instruction teams or
school improvement teams. When building an integrated MTSS, communication is important
both within and between teams. We recommend having one Core MTSS Team and as many sub-
teams as needed by your school.  
A member from each sub-team should be a representative at the Core Team meetings. A sub-
team may work with specialized data to address speciﬁc concerns or plans, and these activities
reach colleagues and the district through the Core Team. The Core Team facilitates cross-
disciplinary collaboration. This structure is especially beneﬁcial for bringing multiple services
to students with complex challenges (without duplication) and for considering multiple
problem-solving perspectives on a single challenge.

Developing your school teams: Start where you are.
Identify existing teams in your school building that focus on academics, behavior, and positive
health and wellbeing. Build upon these existing teams when possible and consider recruiting
new members or restructuring a subcommittee from an existing team when needed. 
Otherwise, create necessary teams by engaging those individuals with the knowledge and
expertise to meet the school's identiﬁed MTSS needs.

You will notice that several school level responsibilities mirror those of the DCLT but through
the building level lens.
Keep in mind, one size does not ﬁt all. No matter the size, it is important to recognize what is
feasible in your individual school district and each school building. 
Remember, the MTSS mission in each school, regardless of the number of teams, is to:
- provide all students with an effective, preventative Tier 1 foundation of support 
- respond to student needs for additional supports by understanding root causes
- offer targeted interventions across academics, behavior, and positive health and
wellbeing
- bring data together—a system of exchanging and making effective use of data
- coordinate school-wide practices and expectations
Let’s now look at how DCLT and school leadership teams can work together after this
knowledge check! 


DCLT and School Leadership Teams
Working Together for the Betterment of All
For successful implementation of MTSS, it is critical to establish leadership teams at both
district and school levels. Both teams desire the same outcome: MTSS implementation
throughout their districts, schools, classrooms, and communities. Ongoing collaboration,
coordination, and communication between the school leadership and district leadership are
critical to ensuring that MTSS is achieving that outcome! 
While the district provides the overarching framework, the school leadership must be
responsive while moving forward to ensure that student needs are met, the staff is trained and
supported, and the identiﬁed components of MTSS are in effect. 
Let's look at the difference between the district and school teams more in depth now!

District and School Team Distinction
Take a moment to review the graphic below which
depicts the objectives for each team in a Venn diagram. 
Venn diagram depicting district and school leadership MTSS responsibilities 
As you can tell from the Venn diagram, there is a lot of overlap between DCLT leadership and
school leadership. However, they are still unique from one another! 
TABLE HERE
School and district leaders must continuously communicate and engage in ongoing study and
analysis of data in order to improve instruction, intervention, and assessment. When MTSS is
implemented with ﬁdelity, it is the students and staff who beneﬁt.
The above information was adapted from original materials provided by the Washington
State Offfce of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Original materials may be
accessed here.
Let’s move forward to some practical tips and resources you can use to maximize the
effectiveness of your teams after a knowledge check! 



Practical Tips for Teams
Making the Most of Your Time Together
Traveling with others, no matter how close you are with them or how well constructed the
roadmap is, can be diffcult. Complications arise, plans change, and sometimes attitudes or
behaviors clash.  
We know that teaming can be complicated. After all, teams are made up of multiple individuals,
coming together from different backgrounds, roles, and ultimate desired outcomes. It makes
sense that it would be diffcult! To help navigate teams and avoid potential complications,
review the following sections on effective team meetings and Team-Initiated Problem Solving
(TIPS)!

Effective Team Meetings 
Sometimes it may seem like there is a never-ending cycle of meetings. Too many meetings leave
staff exhausted and questioning, "what is the point?" Holding too many meetings leads to
discouragement and "meeting fatigue." Below are a few tips to help alleviate the stress caused
by meetings and ensure their effectiveness.  
-Meet Regularly: Create a consistent meeting schedule for your team based on the school's particular needs.
Regularly scheduled meetings on a speciﬁc day and time signal importance and encourage
attendance and participation. Consistency also promotes preparation and focus. 
Assign tasks: Depending on the primary focus of your team, roles within the team may look different.  Here are
examples of general member tasks and responsibilities that will promote smooth effective team
meetings: 
	a) Meeting Facilitator: Creates the agenda and guides the meeting process; manages
	discussions and decision-making activities. 
	b) Meeting Recorder: Records minutes highlighting decisions, tasks and actions.   
	c) Data Lead: Prepares and disseminates visual representation of key data prior to meeting.  
	d)Timekeeper: Moves agenda forward and watches time. 
-Prepare an agenda: Prepare an agenda and distribute it to the team in advance. Also, be prepared to display the agenda
for all team members to view during the meeting. Helpful features of an agenda include time
allotment for each item and team member names for those leading each discussion topic, if
different from facilitator. There should be time allotted for any new or unexpected information,
but before each meeting, members should identify and gather necessary materials to support
team decision making.   
In the next video, Principal Jordan Surdam discusses
how her school leadership team functions to get the
most out of their meetings through their MTSS efforts.
Now that you’ve reviewed how to have effective team meetings, let’s move on to examine how
we can be better problem solvers as a team!   

Team-Initiated Problem-Solving (TIPS)
If only problem-solving during meetings was an easy process! As you've probably experienced
yourself at one point, there are barriers to conducting effcient problem-solving meetings
including:
- limited time scheduled for meetings
- gaps in foundations (e.g., location, team members, procedures, the effciency of meetings)
- an unfocused or unidentiﬁed purpose for meeting
- inadequate training and support to implement effective and effcient problem solving
Solving the challenges that come along when schools are trying to improve outcomes for
students and practices for educators has to be done by using a data-informed decision making
process. Data-informed decision making is important because it ensures that the problems are
clearly and accurately identiﬁed, and speciﬁc targeted solutions can be applied. 
TIPS is a scientiﬁcally based approach for data-informed decision making. TIPS is applicable
for varied data sources, content areas (e.g., academics, behavior), and levels of application (e.g.,
school, district, state). 
The TIPS framework addresses barriers by breaking down problem-solving into six critical
steps to guide teams through a data-informed decision making process that leads to desired
outcomes.  
1. Identify a problem with precision: Teams identify who, what, when, where, why,
and current level for every problem that requires a solution  
2. Identify a goal for change: Teams set a goal that deﬁnes levels at which the problem
is no longer a problem  
3. Identify solution and create a plan: Teams brainstorm
solutions and decide what they are going to do to bring about desired change (i.e., meet their goal)
4. Implement the solution with high integrity: Teams implement and use data to
determine if they did what they said they would do  
5. Monitor the impact of the solution and compare it against the goal: Teams use
outcome data to determine if the solution is having the desired impact on the
outcome/goal  
6. Make summative evaluation decisions: Teams use ﬁdelity and outcome data to
determine what to do next

You can also use the attached link below to review the TIPS practice guide for data teaming and
making decisions. The guide was originally developed for the Center on Positive Behavioral
Interventions and Supports, and it provides guidance for schoolwide PBIS teams. However,
intervention coordination teams, student study teams, and other teams can use it as well.

TIPS includes recommendations on: 
- the foundations needed to organize and run meetings more effciently 
- a process for using data to identify school needs and goals for change as well as for
planning practical and effective solutions, and 
- a process for using, monitoring, and adapting solutions

As you can see, these videos put the theory you’d been reading about into motion! 
If you’re thinking about implementing the TIPS process, it is critical that teams are
supported by a coach who has been trained in the TIPS framework. They can facilitate the
ffrst two meetings, provide prompts and guides, and support the team by monitoring their
ffdelity and providing feedback. 
You’ve worked through a lot of material on teams! Be proud of yourself. All that’s left is a
knowledge check before the review, and you’re on your way to “Resource Mapping and Needs
Assessment”!

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- Teams at the district and school level are made up of stakeholders, such as school
administrators, family members and caregivers, educators, school psychologists
and more
- The DCLT’s responsibilities include ensuring MTSS alignment in the district,
increasing stakeholder support, allocating resources to schools as needed 
- The school leadership team focuses on, among other things, MTSS implementation
within the building, providing evidence-based interventions, and reviewing that
implementation is done with ﬁdelity 
- Effective meeting practices involves a regular meeting schedule, clearly assigned
tasks, and clear agendas; TIPS can also be implemented for extra support

Resource Mapping and Needs Assessment
Outcomes:
1. Describe the purposes and beneﬁts of resource mapping and needs assessment
2. Explore how resource mapping and needs assessment can advance school mental
health systems, including access to high quality programs and services
3. Reﬂect on a strategic abandonment tool for sunsetting programs that are not working
for your school or district
4. Connect resource mapping and needs assessment goals
Resources in the School Setting
Illuminating the Path to Enhanced Student Support and Wellbeing
In the school setting, there are numerous resources available to support mental health. These
resources can be mapped, expanded, or reviewed as part of a resource mapping process for
effective behavioral health systems. 
Examples of these resources include school counselors who provide support and screening,
 school psychologists who provide assessments, mental health clinics and practitioners who
offer specialized services like therapy and psychiatric evaluations, peer support programs that
empower students to provide support to their peers, crisis intervention teams trained to
respond to mental health emergencies, and mental health awareness programs that reduce
stigma and promote mental health literacy. Additionally, community partnerships with local
mental health agencies, online resources and apps, support groups, and initiatives involving
parents and caregivers can also contribute to a comprehensive mental health support system in
schools.   
Visualize these resources with the table below. 
- School-based Mental Health
- Academic Enrichment Programs
- RBHS
- After School Programs
- School Counseling
- Tutoring
- Crisis Teams
- Support Groups
- Crisis Hotlines
By identifying and leveraging these resources, schools can build a strong foundation for
addressing students' mental health needs.

What is Resource Mapping?
Resource mapping refers to the process of identifying and cataloging the resources available
within a school or educational system to support students' mental health and wellbeing. It
involves systematically gathering information about the existing resources, services, and
programs related to mental health, both within the school itself and in collaboration with
external organizations or agencies.  
Resource mapping is a systems-building, expansion and review
process. There are many useful products that can be created during this
process. One of the most common products is a detailed "map" that
visually represents available resources (e.g., programs or services),
along with details about service features, accessibility, and associated
personnel. A comprehensive resource map should have information
about internal and external assets.   
Internal assets are resources available within the organization or system itself, such as
school personnel, programs, facilities, and policies. External assets are resources
obtained through partnerships with outside organizations, such as community clinics,
government agencies, universities, and parent/community involvement. 
Within MTSS, resources can be mapped across the tiers to better meet students' needs. It's
important to create resource maps speciﬁcally designed for students and their parents or
caregivers to address a range of mental health needs. Because resources and needs change, be
mindful to conduct resource mapping with some regularity. An annual review process is a great
starting goal.

Why is Resource Mapping Important? 
Thoughtful resource maps give school staff, students, and families a better understanding of
available resources and services! 
Having valuable resources strategically mapped can improve communication, collaboration,
problem-solving, and access to the most helpful programs and services. Resource maps help
teams avoid duplicating services, minimize confusion and stress for service users, and maintain
records of program or service usage, popularity, evidence base, and local outcomes. 
By strategically mapping valuable resources, schools can enhance communication,
collaboration, problem-solving, and access to the most helpful programs and services.
Resource mapping is invaluable for schools connecting or collaborating with external programs
and services, including social services, behavioral health services, and community programs. 
In order to embark on effective resource mapping, it's important to know where and how to
start. The following section will provide guidance on initiating the resource mapping process
and maximizing its beneﬁts within the school setting. 

Resource Mapping: Where and How to Start 
If you were just introduced to resource mapping for the ﬁrst time, you may be wondering how
or where to start. Consider the following questions as a starting point for your resource
mapping journey. 
Use the click-through picture to get a better look at
these questions. 
What are your goals and objectives?
Clarify the specific purpose of your resource mapping efforts. Are you looking to identify gaps in mental
health services, enhance collaboration with community organizations, or improve access to resources for
students and families? Clearly defining your goals will guide your resource mapping process.
Who should be involved?
Identify the key stakeholders who should be part of the resource mapping process. This may include
school administrators, teachers, counselors, support staff, students, parents, and community partners.
Engaging a diverse range of perspectives will enrich the mapping process and ensure comprehensive
coverage of resources. 
What resources already exist?
Take inventory of the resources that currently exist within your school or educational system. This
includes internal assets such as staff expertise, programs, facilities, and policies, as well as external assets
like community partnerships and available services. Documenting and categorizing these resources will
form the foundation of your resource map.
What resources are needed?
Assess the needs and gaps in your school's mental health support system. Consider the specific challenges
or requirements identified by students, staff, and families. This will help you identify the types of
resources and services that need to be mapped and prioritized. 
How will you gather information?
Determine the methods and tools you will use to collect information about available resources. This may
involve surveys, interviews, consultations with stakeholders, or research on existing programs and
services. Explore both online and offline sources to gather a comprehensive understanding of the
resources available in your school community. 
How will you organize the information?
Decide on the structure and format of your resource map. This can be done using digital tools,
spreadsheets, or even physical maps. Consider categorizing resources based on different criteria such as
type of service, target population, location, or availability. Visual representations, such as color-coding or
symbols, can make the map easier to understand and navigate.
How will you maintain the information?
Establish a plan for regularly updating the resource map to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Assign
responsibilities for maintaining and reviewing the information and establish a process for incorporating
new resources and removing outdated ones. This will help ensure that the resource map remains a
valuable tool over time.
By considering these questions and following a structured approach, you can lay the
groundwork for an effective resource mapping process. Remember, resource mapping is a
dynamic and ongoing endeavor that can lead to improved support systems and enhanced
outcomes for students and their wellbeing. 

Resource Mapping: A Dynamic and Customizable Process
Resource mapping is a process, meaning that it involves a series of systematic and organized
steps to identify, document, and analyze available resources. Resource mapping is not a one-
time event but rather an ongoing and dynamic activity that requires continuous assessment and
updating. 
The process of resource mapping typically includes activities such as identifying goals and
objectives, engaging stakeholders, gathering information about existing resources, assessing
needs and gaps, organizing and visualizing the information, and maintaining the resource map
over time. These steps help ensure that the resource mapping effort is thorough,
comprehensive, and responsive to the evolving needs of the school or organization.
The graphic below demonstrates a resource mapping process plan. Take a close look. What
might you add or change if you were doing this at your school or district? For example, if your
school already has a map for academic resources, you may want a planning step to review,
combine or expand the existing resource map!

Resource Mapping Practice Guides
Resource mapping practice guides provide valuable guidance for effectively conducting resource
mapping in various contexts. These guides offer step-by-step instructions, best practices, and
practical tips to support individuals and organizations in their resource mapping endeavors.
When you utilize these guides, you can navigate the resource mapping process more effectively
and maximize the beneﬁts of this strategic approach to identifying, utilizing, and enhancing
available resources.
Resource mapping encompasses four key practice steps.
Click on each tab below to investigate these steps in
detail.
Step 1: Pre-Planning –
Gather a pre-planning team. Choose team members with a range of leadership roles in your
school who can quickly identify critical needs and comprehensive resources. Key leadership roles
usually include administrative leadership, school psychologists, student services coordinators,
case managers, teachers, and mental health counselors. With your team, discuss your resource
mapping goals and create a plan to achieve those goals. 
See the Pre-Planning worksheet to help you structure your pre-planning meeting.
Step 2: Mapping Resources –
Meet with your goal-speciﬁc team (expand as needed). Begin mapping resources as relevant to
achieving your identiﬁed goals. The simplest way to start is to use a spreadsheet program such as
Excel or a table in Word (or other word processor). Digital resources are fast and easy to edit and
print out.
Check out the Categorizing Resources worksheet as a guide to visualize and organize your
information.
Step 3: Analyzing Resources –
Once you have organized, categorized, and documented your relevant resources, it is time to
analyze what you have found and create additional plans and products. When analyzing
resources, keep in mind your goals and consider all appropriate and available data.
See the Analyzing Resources worksheet to guide you in your analyses.
Step 4: Maintaining the Map –
Resource mapping is an ongoing process. It can be used to meet speciﬁc needs more effectively
and effciently over time. You will need to adapt your resource maps (and other products) over
time to meet shifting needs and optimize changing resources. The best resource maps are easily
accessible to all the students, staff, and families who need to use them. Resource maps can also be
instrumental for large-scale decision-making processes, funding, and equity initiatives!

Resource Mapping Across Tiers
Optimizing Supports for Student Needs
A great way for teachers and other caring adults to use resource maps is to review, select, and
connect with resources that meet their students' needs.
Do your students have their:
- behavioral health
- physical health
- relationship
- academic
needs addressed?
When you identify a student with unmet needs, you can use resource maps to address those
particular needs. For example, for academic needs, you might ﬁnd or create a list of tutors,
after-school activities, and academic enrichment programs. To avoid duplication of efforts, it is
best to communicate about existing resource maps during team meetings and at a range of
school community gatherings.

Enhancing Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) Using Resource Maps
Resource mapping across tiers refers to the application of resource mapping at different levels
or tiers within a system. In the context of school mental health, this typically involves
considering resources and supports available at multiple levels of intervention. 
Resources needed to promote mental health and behavioral concerns for all students should be
mapped at Tier 1. Greater intensity and more speciﬁc resources intended for only some students
can be mapped into Tier 2. The most individualized and intensive resources belong to Tier 3. 
Targeted Supports:
This tier focuses on resources and interventions for students who may require additional support beyond
the universal level. It involves identifying resources that are specifically targeted towards a subgroup of
students who exhibit specific needs or risk factors. Examples of tier 2 resources could include small group
counseling, social skills training, or targeted prevention programs. 
Intensive Supports:
This tier involves resources and interventions for students who require intensive and individualized
support. These resources are typically provided to a smaller group of students who have significant mental
health needs. Examples may include individual counseling, specialized therapeutic interventions, or
collaboration with external mental health professionals.
Universal Supports:
This tier includes resources that are available to all students as part of a universal approach to promoting
mental health and wellbeing. Examples may include school-wide mental health awareness programs,
positive behavior interventions, and school climate initiatives.

Organizing programs and services into Tiers and "layering," or offering services
simultaneously, helps to reduce the need for high-intensity services over time and match the
service intensity to the student need! 
Think about your school community's needs and the program's delivery capacity when placing
a program or service into a Tier. Do all or most students need this support at school, or just
some or a few students? Can the program or service accommodate the need?

Locating Resources
Locating resources is crucial for effcient utilization, meeting speciﬁc needs, avoiding
duplication, fostering collaboration, and making informed decisions. It ensures resources are
allocated effectively, provides timely access to necessary support, focuses efforts where gaps
exist, enables partnerships, and supports effective planning. Overall, resource location
optimizes resource utilization and enhances the ability to meet the needs of individuals and
communities. 
There are various ways to locate different services and supports. Please visit the links below to
aid you in locating resources. 



Needs Assessment in the School Setting 
Examining the Current Landscape
Needs assessment plays a crucial role in the realm of school mental health as it provides a
systematic and comprehensive approach to understanding the speciﬁc needs and challenges
faced by students. Conducting a needs assessment in the school setting allows educators,
administrators, and mental health professionals to gain valuable insights into the unique
mental health needs of students while enabling them to develop targeted interventions and
support systems. This process involves collecting and analyzing data to identify the prevalent
mental health issues, risk factors, and protective factors within the school community. 
Through a collaborative and evidence-based approach, needs assessment in the school setting
paves the way for the implementation of effective interventions that address the mental health
needs of students, promoting their overall wellbeing and academic success. 

What is a Needs Assessment? 
A needs assessment is a collaborative process that aims to identify and address challenges and
gaps within an organization, enabling a better understanding of the areas where improvement
or support is needed. Identifying pressing needs can inform quality improvement activities,
intervention selections, resource allocation, and professional development choices in schools,
districts, and state education agencies.
"Assessment is the process of collecting data to make
decisions” (Salvia & Ysseldyke, 1998). 
As stated by Professors Salvia and Ysseldyke, in the context of school mental health, a needs
assessment serves as a comprehensive approach to gathering data and informing decision
making. 
A school conducts a needs assessment to understand the mental health needs of students. The
process begins with gathering data through surveys, interviews, and focus groups involving
students, parents, teachers, and staff members. The assessment examines various aspects,
such as students' emotional wellbeing, prevalence of mental health concerns, access to support
services, and perception of school climate. Based on these ﬁndings, the school identiﬁes
speciﬁc areas for improvement.  
The needs assessment provides valuable insights for the school to develop targeted
interventions, allocate resources effectively, and collaborate with community partners to
address the identiﬁed needs. Regular assessments allow the school to monitor progress, make
necessary adjustments, and ensure continuous improvement in supporting the mental health
needs of their students. 

Assessment Continuation: Comprehensive Evaluation Over
Time in the School Setting 
Assessments are done over a period of time, also called a continuation. A continuation of
assessments within a school could include administrative data review, screening, progress
monitoring, and evaluation. 
Click through the picture below to learn more about the
continuation of assessments. 
Screening:
In the needs assessment process, screening involves conducting school-wide screenings to identify
students who may require additional support. This could include screening for academic, behavioral,
social, or emotional concerns. When schools assess who is and is not responding to the initial supports
provided, they can gain insights into the effectiveness of their interventions and identify areas that require
further attention. 
Progress Monitoring:
Progress monitoring is an essential component of needs assessment. It involves regularly assessing the
effectiveness and fidelity of the interventions (meaning the degree to which intervention is implemented
as originally designed or intended) implemented for students. This could include tracking students'
academic progress, behavioral changes, social, or emotional development over time. Monitoring progress
guides schools to make data-informed decisions, adjust interventions as needed, and ensure that students
are making meaningful gains.
Evaluation:
Evaluation is a crucial aspect of needs assessment that focuses on assessing the overall effectiveness of the
initiatives and interventions implemented within the school. It involves analyzing the data collected,
examining the outcomes achieved, and evaluating the impact of the implemented strategies. Conducting
comprehensive evaluations helps schools to determine the success of their efforts, identify areas of
improvement, and inform future decision-making to better meet the needs of their students.

Beneﬁts of Conducting Needs Assessments 
Conducting needs assessments in the school setting offers several beneﬁts. These assessments
help identify areas of improvement by systematically gathering data and pinpointing gaps in
resources and services. They also allow schools to tailor interventions and support based on the
speciﬁc needs of students, leading to more effective strategies. Needs assessments inform
decision-making by providing data-driven information and help schools allocate resources
more effciently. They promote collaboration among stakeholders and encourage partnerships
for meeting student needs. Additionally, needs assessments help monitor progress, evaluate
outcomes, and drive continuous improvement. Overall, conducting needs assessments
enhances the understanding of challenges, informs targeted interventions, and improves
outcomes for students.

Conducting a schoolwide needs assessment allows you to: 
- identify challenges experienced by most or all students, indicating a need for Tier 1
 programming improvements 
- monitor student progress and growth collectively and for speciﬁc social groups (e.g., by
 age, race, ethnicity, special education, or language status) 
- balance needs and resources equitably 
- set goals for resource mapping and systems-building efforts
Having discussed the beneﬁts of conducting needs assessments in the school setting, it is
crucial to reﬂect on the importance of having a needs assessment speciﬁcally for mental health
in schools. Mental health plays a signiﬁcant role in students' overall wellbeing and academic
success. Understanding and addressing their mental health needs is essential for creating a
supportive and nurturing learning environment. A needs assessment for mental health allows
schools to identify speciﬁc challenges and gaps in mental health support services. It helps in
tailoring interventions and resources to meet the unique needs of students, ensuring that
appropriate and effective mental health support is provided. 
Now, let's take a minute to consider the mental health
needs of students with the reffection questions below. 
- How can a needs assessment for mental health help schools identify and prioritize speciﬁc
 mental health needs among students? 
- In what ways can a needs assessment contribute to the development of tailored and
 effective mental health interventions and support services? 
- How can a needs assessment for mental health foster collaboration and partnerships with
 external agencies and community resources to enhance the overall mental wellbeing of
 students? 
What are some potential challenges or barriers that schools may face when conducting a
needs assessment for mental health, and how can they be addressed? 
By contemplating these questions, you can gain a better understanding of the signiﬁcance of
needs assessments in addressing the mental health needs of students in schools and fostering
a supportive and inclusive learning environment.




Exploring Classroom-Level Needs Assessments 
Distinguishing Whole School and Classroom Needs Assessments
When conducting a needs assessment, it's important to understand the distinction between
assessing the needs of an entire school and assessing the needs of a speciﬁc classroom. While
both approaches share the goal of identifying areas of improvement, they differ in their scope
and focus. 
A whole school needs assessment involves gathering information and data from various
stakeholders across the entire school community, including administrators, teachers, support
staff, students, and parents. This comprehensive assessment aims to capture the broader
needs, challenges, and priorities of the entire school. It provides a holistic view of the school's
strengths and areas for growth, allowing for the development of targeted strategies and
interventions at the school-wide level.
On the other hand, a classroom needs assessment focuses speciﬁcally on assessing the needs
and learning requirements of a particular classroom or group of students. It involves gathering
information about the speciﬁc strengths, weaknesses, and individual needs of students within
that classroom. This type of assessment allows teachers to tailor their instruction, differentiate
learning activities, and provide appropriate support and resources to meet the diverse needs of
their students. 
While a whole school needs assessment provides a big picture view and informs school-wide
initiatives, a classroom needs assessment enables teachers to address the unique needs of their
students in a targeted and individualized manner. Both approaches are valuable and
complement each other in creating a supportive and responsive learning environment. 

Tips for Developing a Needs Assessment
