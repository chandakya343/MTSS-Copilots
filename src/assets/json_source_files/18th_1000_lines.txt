Consider the age and developmental stage of the student. Younger children may have limited self-
awareness, making caregiver or teacher assessments more reliable. Older students, on the other
hand, can provide meaningful self-assessments. Select measures that are developmentally
appropriate.
CONTEXT 

Think about the context in which the assessment will be administered. School-based assessments
may beneﬁt from educator/teacher assessments, while home-based assessments may rely more
on family/guardian reports. Consider the setting in which the student spends most of their time.
MULTIPLE MEASURES 

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the student's wellbeing, consider using multiple
measure types. Combining self-assessments, teacher assessments, and family assessments can
provide a holistic view, capturing a wider range of experiences and behaviors.
Let's review the lesson.
Progress monitoring is a process for tracking both academic and behavioral
progress in students, playing a key role in the MTSS framework.
Creating SMARTIE goals is important for developing meaningful and measurable
intervention plans for students with Tier 3 mental health needs.
To gain a comprehensive understanding of a student's progress, it is essential to
monitor various aspects beyond symptoms, such as academic performance,
attendance, relationships, and overall wellbeing.
Providing feedback to students and their families based on progress data fosters
collaboration and trust, enhancing the effectiveness of interventions and
supporting students' engagement in the process.
Recognizing when to adapt, change, or conclude intervention plans based on
progress monitoring results is essential for tailoring support to students' evolving
needs and achieving successful outcomes.

Growing Your Tier 3 Supports - 1.4
Welcome to Growing Your Tier 3 Supports  In this course, you will learn about the
interventions, best practices, and implementation of Tier 3 of Multi-tiered System
of Supports (MTSS), with a focus on supporting behavioral and mental health. Like
seeds planted in a garden, growing supports at Tier 3 creates a beautiful garden
where everyone is ﬂourishing. Let's get started
Mental Health Crisis Management


@@@@@ 
Lesson 1 of 1
Mental Health Crisis Management
Outcomes: 

1. Recognize the types of stress and their role in mental health crises
2. Summarize the core elements of suicide prevention and intervention, with an emphasis
on the Multi-Tiered System of Supports
3.  Facilitate suicide screening and collaborative safety planning
Crisis Management
Knowing Ourselves in Midst of Crisis
The mere mention of the word "crisis" tends to stir up strong emotions. Fear, urgency,
concern, and empathy are just a few of the feelings that may arise. The term "crisis" also
prompts a natural instinct to take immediate action to address the situation.
Regardless of the severity or intensity of the crisis, maintaining a composed approach is key to
effectively assisting the individual. While being calm may seem counterintuitive in a crisis
situation, a calm demeanor helps create a safe and reassuring environment. Responsiveness
ensures that appropriate actions are taken promptly and tailored to the speciﬁc needs of the
individual and the situation at hand. It's easier to see what a person or situation needs when you
can remain cool, calm, and collected.
When a person ﬁnds themselves in a crisis, it is often an indication that they are stressed and
require assistance. Their behavior serves as a form of communication, signaling that they are in
distress and need support. 
Addressing crises within a school setting necessitates a collaborative e ort involving educators,
administrators, mental health professionals, students, and often parents. Awareness of
available resources, both within the school and in the broader community, ensures that
appropriate support can be accessed when needed.
In this lesson, we are focusing on crises related speciﬁcally to mental health, with the greatest
potential mental health crisis being suicide. We will start by brieﬂy discussing types of stress
and possible behavioral responses to perceived threats. 
Stress and Its Impact 

We all experience varying degrees of stress in our lives. Individual response to stress reﬂects
our environment, relationships, lived and learned experiences, and the amount of stressors one
is navigating. This is like the analogy of "how full is your cup," or more appropriately in this
context, "how heavy is your backpack?"
Let's take a moment to review the different types of
stress before we look at responses to perceived threats.
Click through the tabs below
Positive Stress 

Positive stress is experienced as the body's normal and healthy response to a tense situation or
event. It promotes adaptability and change. Positive stress is also the type of stress you feel when
you are excited or take on a new challenge
The experience of positive stress can lend itself to the development of a sense of agency, self-
efficacy, and resilience. In this case, stress is predictable, moderate, and controllable.
Think of this like taking a long hike by yourself. It can be tough, exhausting, and it can take a lot
out of you. However, you know you can do it, you've prepared, and are excited for that rush of
endorphins when you ﬁnish.
Tolerable Stress 

Tolerable stress encompasses a heightened activation of the body's systemic response to a
longer-lasting situation or severe event. Tolerable stress is manageable when accompanied by
supportive relationships and strong social and emotional skills and resources.
Think of hiking again. Maybe the hike takes longer than expected, or you twist your ankle.
Thankfully, this time you went with a friend who is there to help you along the way. It sucks, but
you know you'll be okay.
Toxic Stress 

When experiencing toxic stress, the body stays in a heightened state of activation, meaning the
system is ready for "ﬁght, ﬂight, or freeze." The body does not settle down and may ignore
signals about the surrounding environment returning to a safe level.
This sustained activation negatively impacts brain function, making it prone to: 
Anxiety
Depression
Impaired learning and memory
Hypervigilance 
Reduced attention span
Difficulties experiencing joy and connection
Difficulties responding appropriately to non-threatening situations
In this verion of the hiking example, you are alone and lost with no phone signal and it is getting
dark. If positive stress is motivating and tolerable stress is challenging, toxic stress is crushing.
Not all stress is adverse, but prolonged exposure to stress, especially
episodic and unpredictable stress, can have significant negative
mental and physical health outcomes.
It is important to consider that lived experience impacts behavior as well as perceptions of
safety and security. Students with a signiﬁcant history of adverse experiences or high doses of
toxic stress are more likely to respond to daily challenges or moderate stressors more reactively
compared to other students.
As you build relationships and learn about your students, you can consider these stressors. You
see these patterns of behaviors in the narratives they share or within the relational dynamics of
the family system. You may also see how these survival mode behaviors play out during the
school day.
Let's take a moment to review what  ght,  ight, or freeze
might look like in the table below
Table describing example ﬁght, ﬂight, and freeze behaviors
Recognizing Our Own Response 

Now that we recognize that behavior can communicate
dysregulation, what should we consider or do next?
You might be shouting from the rooftops, "Respond to
the behavior ,"   but let's take a calming breath
rst...literally.
You are human too. You've been on the receiving end of some intense
emotional responses. You have lived experiences that inform your
responses as well. You deserve a moment to check in with yourself,
regulate, and then respond. After all, modeling healthy behaviors is
key for student learning.
Once the adults are regulated, it is far more likely that a response
such as teaching a replacement behavior or helping the dysregulated
student identify a more effective response can occur.
If you took the "All Hands on Deck" course, you might recall that the role of a supportive adult is
to be the "calm in the storm." This does not mean that you, or the other adult(s) involved, may
not be navigating some stormy seas as well. As a safe adult, you must give yourself some grace
to return to calmer waters so that a healthier, corrective exchange can blossom. 
Let's take a moment right now to practice a simple regulation
technique.
Feet  at on the ground, quiet mind...
Deep breath in counting 1,  2,  3,  4...
Exhale counting 1, 2, 3, 4...
Repeat 3 times, or until you feel ready to move forward with your
lesson.
Looking Closer at Suicide 

A Mental Health Crisis
We mentioned earlier that suicide is one of the mental health crises that you may encounter. In
this section of this lesson, you will review e orts for identifying and responding to suicidal
crises.
Before you move on, remember: Suicide is about escaping
pain, not death or dying. We treat pain. We manage pain. We
relieve pain.
All of the e orts connected to both the reduction of suicide risk and response to a suicide crisis
are about promoting hope and resiliency. 
Supporting students, families, and communities that have been impacted by suicide is difficult
work. Recognizing that you are not immune to the pain and trauma of these circumstances is
also critical. You must give yourself space and grace to work through your own emotions,
beliefs, and attitudes related to suicide.
It is important to recognize that recovery is not an end state, but a journey. It does not mean that
the individual is no longer living with symptoms of their mental illness. Instead, recovery
means that an individual is stabilized, has effective coping skills and supports, and can
successfully navigate their day.
Suicide is not an easy topic, so please put yourself  rst.  If you feel
you may need some support, please connect to a colleague with a
kind ear, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, or text
"HOPE" to 741741 to reach a trained crisis counselor with United
Way's Crisis Text Line.
Take a moment to watch the video of Jordan's Story.
Stories of Hope and Recovery: Jordan's Story
Stories of Hope and Recovery: Jordan's Story
Jordan's story can be hard to hear, yet the intersection of psychiatry and therapy after his
suicide attempt reminds us that our work matters. He also reminds us that suicide is something
anyone can feel the weight of, not just individuals who "look" suicidal. With Jordan's story in
mind, let's move forward
Learning the Language 

The words that we use broadly to discuss suicide can function to reduce stigma. As a source of
support in your building, you have the opportunity to inﬂuence positive change related to
perceptions of suicide. This change starts with the language.
There are phrases that have been used historically that, unbeknownst to many professionals
and community members alike, perpetuate stigma about suicide.   
Let's take a moment to ensure that we are using
language that communicates safety, awareness, and
respect for lived experience.
Survivor 

The term is used for any individual who attempted suicide but is still here with us today. They
navigated a serious mental health crisis and now continue to show strength and perseverance
through their recovery journey.
Loss Survivor 

Any individual who lost a loved one or family member to suicide.
Died by Suicide 

Historically the term "committed suicide" has been used to describe someone ending their life.
The word "commit" has negative associations such as "commit a crime.  A health crisis is not a
crime.
Interrupted Attempt 

This term is used for a suicide attempt where "individuals initiate action to end their lives but are
stopped by someone or something external to the individual before actually carrying out the act."
(Burke et al., 2016)
Aborted Attempt 

This term is used for a suicide attempt where "individuals start to do something to try to end
their lives but stop themselves before actually harming themselves." (Posner, et al., 2011).
Actual Attempt 

This term is used when an individual follows through with their plan to end their life but survives.
Completed 

This term is used to describe actual attempts or loss of life to suicide. The language replaces the
more harmful term "successful."
Keeping this language in mind allows for a more empathetic, less stigmatized conversation
about suicide to be had.
Knowing the Data 

Confronting the prevalence and scope of the impact of suicide through data can be difficult.
Suicide does not discriminate. It is important to note that the data gives a strong representation
of suicide experience but does not reﬂect the true scope of the problem. In other words, the data
is staggering, but it does not capture all that is impacted by suicide.
Take a moment to review the data sets below and reﬂect on how this information might impact
your prevention and intervention supports at each tier of your MTSS.
YOUTH RISK DATA 

Results from the 2019 Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System show that 18.8% (i.e., 1 in
5) of high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, 8.9% (i.e., 1 in 11) actually
attempted suicide, and 2.5% (i.e., 1 in 40) had made a suicide attempt requiring medical
treatment.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WISQARS Leading Causes of
Death Reports for 2019, the teen suicide rate is higher among: 
Males compared with females. However, females attempt suicide more often than males.
American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents compared with other racial and ethnic groups.
White adolescents have a higher suicide rate compared with Asian/Paciﬁc Islander, Hispanic
and Black adolescents.
Suicide attempts are higher among students who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual
compared with students who identify as heterosexual.
Suicide is the 12th leading cause of death for youth aged 5-9, the 2nd leading cause of death
for youth aged 10-14, and the 3rd leading cause of death for youth aged 15-24.
SOUTH CAROLINA DATA 

South Carolina has several suicide prevention e orts. Currently, South Carolina has written into
law:
Inclusion of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and other crisis lines on student ID
cards
Suicide prevention and mental health training for certain school personnel
Student education on mental health
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has additional best-practice considerations for
enhancement in your district:
Student allowances for excused mental health absences
School personnel must report student suicide risk to a parent and/or guardian
Student education in suicide prevention
For more information about suicide in South Carolina, review the graphic below. Click to enlarge. 
NATIONAL DATA 

On a national level, suicide also has a far-reaching impact. According to America s Health
Rankings (2022), the cost of suicide in the United States in 2019 was estimated to be $926 billion
(about $2,800 per person) in medical costs, loss of productivity, and value of statistical life.
The National Institute of Mental Health reports that:
The rates of suicide in 2020 were highest for American Indian, Non-Hispanic males (37.4 per
100,000), followed by White, Non-Hispanic males (27.0 per 100,000). Among females the
rates of suicide were highest for American Indian, Non-Hispanic females (10.8 per 100,000)
and White, Non-Hispanic females (6.9 per 100,000).
In 2020, ﬁrearms were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the United
States, accounting for over half of all suicide deaths (24,292).

Behavior Among High School Students , National Institute of Mental Health Suicide

Resources.
Understanding the Stigma 

As we discussed throughout the course, stigma is a signiﬁcant barrier to individuals accessing
the types of support that promote wellbeing. There is no greater barrier to ending suicide than
stigma. If you are learning to grow Tier 3 supports to help students through this mental health
crisis, you can view stigma as concrete being poured over fertile soil.
This stigma comes in the form of both social stigma and internalized
stigma and can look like the use of stigmatizing language, negative
attitudes towards particular diagnoses where suicide risk is higher,
and a lack of awareness of treatment and management of suicide
risk.
When we recognize that the prevalence of suicide risk is this
prominent, it certainly makes concerns about the impact of stigma
that much worse. Suicide can occur as an outcome of any mental
health diagnosis, but suicidal ideation and/or behavior has a higher
likelihood of occurrence in certain disorders, speciﬁcally:
Borderline Personality Disorder
Major Depressive Disorder
Bipolar Disorder
Sometimes we may shy away from bringing up discussions of suicide
because there is a lack of conﬁdence associated with our personal
perception of effectiveness. This concern is 100%
understandable. Let's work to remove some of these concerns by
increasing our knowledge about suicide and understanding how we
can engage the resources in the school setting  
Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all the darkness

Crisis Response Teams 

Team-based Support
Many schools have a relatively solid team in place as a result of existing MTSS e orts. This
group may be a sub-team of the larger MTSS team, identiﬁed as the Crisis Response Team
(CRT). If your team is yet to be deﬁned, then this is a great opportunity to bring voices, hearts,
and expertise to the table.
A multi-disciplinary team should reﬂect the professionals in your school, have representation
from community resources, and include a family voice. When it comes to intervention response
we want to ensure that, if not already represented, school resource ourcers and school nurses
are intentionally included.
Training for team members on mental health and crisis response is key. In addition to the
development and implementation of protocols, it is recommended that this team review school
policies to ensure that language and strategy are in alignment with best practices to reduce
harm and trauma to vulnerable students and promote mental health. 
As one of the core features of the MTSS framework, teaming aligns with best practices in crisis
response and suicide prevention. The framework allows the adults in the system to be proactive
in screening and referring students at risk of suicide ensuring they receive the support needed
to weather the crisis.
Let's watch this video from Jen Freeman, a national
leader in Crisis Response and Recovery, talking about
strategies for crisis response.
Screening 

Comprehensive suicide prevention programming in schools should include the selection and
use of speciﬁc screening for suicide risk. General mental health screening is not the same as
suicide-speciﬁc screening. 
There are universal screening programs that can be implemented as a Tier 1 intervention as well
as targeted screening tools at Tier 2 and Tier 3. Although universal screening is ideal, aiming for
a robust targeted screening and assessment of risk is a more realistic and achievable goal.
There are a number of cost-effective evidence-based screeners and
screening programs available for use in schools. Ultimately the decision
between the use of a program or the use of a tool to inform procedures
will be a key consideration for the CRT and hinges on the availability of
resources and student body needs. 
The following are guiding questions to inform the selection of an
effective tool:
Is it brief?
Is it easy to administer? Can anyone administer it?
Is it valid?
Does it include questions regarding active and passive ideation, suicide plans,
intention to act, and suicide behavior?
Does the line of questioning attend to both current suicide risk and history of
suicidal ideations?
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) is
the leading suicide-specific screening tool.
Review the image below to explore the tool.
Additional training, forms, and resources for the CSSRS
can be found on the Columbia Lighthouse Project
website. Check out the link below for more information.

Safety Planning 

An integral step, regardless of the level of risk, is the development of a collaborative safety plan.
As the name implies, this process is facilitated mutually between the supportive adult and the
student, with caregiver input. When a plan is created collaboratively there is more buy-in from
the student and family which increases the likelihood that they will implement the plan when
experiencing distress. 
The safety plan enhances resiliency factors by highlighting internal and external coping
strategies. Additionally, using a plan communicates a belief in the student's capacity to tolerate
and manage discomfort and successfully navigate a crisis. This plan is NOT a contract. It is
ineffective to contract around safety. It is unrealistic for someone to "promise" to not have
thoughts about suicide. Instead, a safety plan helps the person commit to using skills and
strategies if those thoughts or feelings occur.
The Stanley-Brown Safety Plan is an effective tool with
a specific set of coping strategies and resources to assist
in decreasing the risk of suicidal behavior.
Review the image below to explore the tool and
download a copy.
Warning Signs 

The warning signs section of the safety plan indicates moods, thoughts, or events that cause distress.
Examples of warning signs may include: 
Getting into a fight with my parents
Having a bad day at school
Feeling isolated
Making a mistake and feeling worthless
Don't worry if the student is struggling to identify these signs. You can coach them through identification
by using the information they share with you. 
Internal Coping Strategies 

These are the strategies the student can use to self-soothe when warning signs of a crisis are present.
These are the personal resources that can be deployed without the assistance of another person. 
Examples of internal coping strategies: 
Listening to music
Going for a walk
Deep breathing exercises
Reading my favorite book
If the student is struggling to identify coping skills, you might recommend options.
People and Places that Provide Distraction 

The next section of the safety plan is for people and social settings that can provide a distraction from
distressing thoughts or feelings. These people and places aren t necessarily meant specifically to talk over
suicidal thoughts but are a source of positive support. 
Examples of people and places that provide distraction are: 
Friends from school
Siblings
Parents or caregivers
Coffee shops
Parks
Libraries
People To Ask for Help 

This step lists supportive, close relationships that students feel comfortable contacting in a crisis. Unlike
the previous step, people in this step can talk through the difficult and distressing feelings the student is
going through.
Examples of people to ask for help in a crisis are: 
Parents or caregivers
Siblings
Close friends
Teachers
Note: it is totally fine if there is an overlap between Steps 3 and 4
Professionals To Contact 

Professionals to contact are typically mental or behavioral health providers. Examples of professionals to
contact include:
School or private practice counselors
Psychiatrists
Psychologists
Emergency rooms
Suicide prevention lifelines (988)
Making the Environment Safer 

The last step lists ways to modify the environment to make it safer. For students with a suicide plan or
access to means, this includes restricting access to those means. 
Some examples include: 
Having parents lock pills in a cabinet
Removing sharp objects, such as knives or razors, from the environment
Locking guns in a safe

Let's review the lesson.
A mental health crisis is any situation in which a person's behavior puts them at
risk of hurting themselves or others and prevents them from being able to care for
themselves effectively. A crisis exists on a continuum of dysregulation.
Many mental health crises may be caused by toxic stress. When experiencing toxic
stress, the body stays in a heightened state of activation, "ﬁght, ﬂight, or freeze."
The body does not settle down and may ignore signals about the surrounding
environment returning to a safe level.
Suicide is one potential mental health crisis that you may encounter. Suicidality
refers to thinking about or being preoccupied with thoughts of suicide. This ranges
from an occasional thought to serious consideration about suicide. Suicide is
the action of ending one's life.
Intervention is anything done to address or lesson a crisis situation. Suicide
intervention is aligned with de-escalating a crisis in the moment, increasing
environmental safety, and preventing attempt behavior that can lead to loss of life.
Prevention e orts come before crisis situations and reduce their likelihood.
effective prevention e orts for schools include positive health and emotional
wellbeing promotion for all and early identiﬁcation of students at risk.
MTSS can support crisis management through its use of teaming. Teaming aligns
with best practices in crisis response and suicide prevention. The MTSS framework
allows the system to be proactive in screening and referring students at risk of
suicide.
