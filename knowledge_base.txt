What is an MTSS Framework? 
Reviewing MTSS
Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for
supporting successful student outcomes and eliminating barriers to learning. It is designed to
identify and address the needs of all students, including those who may be struggling
academically and behaviorally, by providing interventions and supports at varying levels of
intensity.
It's important to clarify that the MTSS framework itself is not an
intervention or speciﬁc curriculum. Instead, it serves as a comprehensive
framework that guides schools in selecting and implementing
appropriate curriculum and interventions based on the needs of their
students. The term "comprehensive" refers to a holistic and all-
encompassing approach to addressing the diverse needs of students. A
framework can be thought of as simply a structured guide or roadmap.
In this case, it is a guide to building the comprehensive system that
serves all students and staff.  
The beauty of the MTSS framework is that it is customizable. This means interventions selected
within the MTSS framework can vary widely based on the unique needs and resources of each
school. There is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach. The framework allows for ﬂexibility, enabling
schools to address the speciﬁc challenges their students, families, and school community face.
As long as schools are using a tiered approach with data-informed decision making, evidence-
based practices, and interventions, they are following MTSS. 

To get started, let's take a moment to review a few key
MTSS terms. Flip each card to read the deffnitions.
MTSS is organized into 3 tiers or
levels of intervention. When you
1 of 6
Tier:  MTSS is organized into 3 tiers or levels of intervention. When you hear tiers, you may think of a ranking system. In MTSS, this is not
the case. Every tier is important and deserves careful attention and planning
2 of 6
Intervention: Intervention is something adults put in place to support students. Some interventions are school-wide, and some are for a
group or individual students. They can address the environment, like changing a student's seat in the classroom. 
3 of 6
Intensity: Intensity refers to how strongly we apply the intervention. Increasing intensity can look like more intervention sessions, scheduling
sessions more often, or increasing the number of weeks of the intervention.
4 of 6
Layering: Layering means applying several interventions at the same time. For instance, all students receiving Tier
2 and Tier 3 support have layered interventions, because they are still exposed to school-wide Tier 1 supports
5 of 6
school community: The school community includes students, families, general and special education teachers, classroom assistants, administrators, paraprofessionals, office staff, custodial staff, cafeteria staff, bus drivers, academic and behavior interventionists, school mental health staff (counselor, psychologist, social worker), school nurses, athletic coaching staff, after-care staff, and community stakeholders.
6 of 6
Fidelity: Fidelity refers to how closely we are practicing the intervention as it was originally developed. When we stick to the intervention (or have high fidelity), we can be more confident that we are addressing the student's issue. If we have low fidelity, or make changes to the original intervention, it may not work as intended or be as effective as possible. 



The Tiered Approach
In the "All Hands on Deck" course, you learned about the tiered infrastructure of the MTSS. The
tiered approach is a central component of MTSS and involves organizing support and
instruction into multiple levels or tiers, each with different levels of intensity and speciﬁcity.
Flip the cards for a quick review.
1 of 3
Tier 1: Universal Supports, This tier focuses on providing high-quality instruction and interventions to all students. It
includes evidence-based teaching strategies, differentiated instruction, and ongoing progress monitoring to ensure that students are
making adequate academic and behavioral progress.
2 of 3
Tier 2: Targeted Supports, Students who require additional support beyond what is provided in Tier 1 receive targeted interventions and supports in Tier 2. These interventions are more individualized and intensive, targeting specific areas of need. Examples of Tier 2 interventions may include small-group instruction, mentoring programs, or social, emotional, and behavioral interventions. 
3 of 3
Tier 3: Intensive Supports, Students who require the most intensive level of support receive individualized interventions and supports in Tier 3. These interventions may involve one-on-one instruction, specialized assessments, and intensive interventions. Students in Tier 3 often receive support from specialists such as special education teachers, counselors, or interventionists. 

At every tier, educators, administrators, and support staff collaborate to select evidence-based
practices that develop skills for groups and individuals. This approach ensures systematic and
focused support for students with diverse academic and behavioral requirements. It
acknowledges the varying needs of students and provides appropriate interventions to improve
overall outcomes.

What does this mean for your school district?
Using the MTSS framework gives schools the power to connect education, health, and mental
health systems to support successful students, schools, and communities. The tiers within the
MTSS system arrange equitable, streamlined, and proﬁcient planning and delivery of services
within the schools. By using the framework in this way, schools can maximize effciency and
support the needs of all students.
Watch the video below as Dr. Lucille Eber, a project coordinator with the Midwest Positive
Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) Network and a collaborative partner with the U.S.
Department of Education’s National PBIS Center, sums up the MTSS framework and how it
works. 

How is MTSS different from other systems or initiatives?
MTSS is designed to serve all students through a combination of universal programming and,
as Dr. Eber described in the video above, a "seamless" connection to support based on
individual student needs. Supports are layered or intensiﬁed based on individual student
strengths, needs, and progress, as well as the overall school community.
MTSS differs from other systems in key ways:
comprehensive and integrated approach
emphasizes data-informed decision making for targeted interventions
fosters collaboration through a team-based approach involving professionals from various
disciplines
takes a proactive stance by aiming to prevent diffculties before they escalate,
distinguishing it from reactive frameworks focused on disciplinary actions or remediation
This multi-faceted approach distinguishes MTSS from other systems that may have a narrower
focus or lack integration across various domains.
Let's listen in some more as Dr. Eber describes how tiered supports should look and feel within
MTSS.  
Many of us have seen initiatives in education come and go. The MTSS framework is
different because it organizes the adults and available resources to meet the needs
of the school population. When district initiatives change, the MTSS framework
remains allowing for consistency and sustainability. 




Practical Steps for Implementing MTSS
Implementing MTSS practices, whether a district is at the beginning or integrating school
mental health into an existing academic multi-tiered system, requires careful planning,
collaboration, and a systematic approach. 

New to MTSS?
Some districts may be at the beginning stages of developing an MTSS infrastructure. In this
case, here is a "to do" list.
1. Establish a leadership team: Create a dedicated leadership team comprising
administrators, teachers, counselors, and other relevant stakeholders to drive the
implementation process. 
2. Develop a shared vision and goals: Clearly articulate the vision, goals, and expected
outcomes of the MTSS implementation. This shared vision will guide decision
making and provide a common understanding among all stakeholders. 
3. Assess readiness and capacity: Evaluate the readiness and capacity of the district,
including available resources, professional development needs, and infrastructure.
This assessment will help identify areas that require additional support or
investment. 
4. Prioritize the foundational components: Focus on establishing the core
components of MTSS, such as high-quality differentiated instruction, meaningful
assessment and progress monitoring, and evidence-based practices. Begin with a
universal framework.
5. Build a data system: Develop a comprehensive data system to collect, analyze, and
use data effectively. This includes implementing data collection tools, establishing
data protocols, and training staff to interpret and utilize the data for decision
making.
6. Provide professional development: Offer ongoing professional development to
educators to build their knowledge and skills in MTSS implementation. This may
involve training on data-informed decision making, instructional strategies,
behavior management, mental health literacy, and collaboration among staff.

That's a big list! But all of this is accomplished in stages of implementation, an effective process
of supporting the long-term commitment of MTSS (National Implementation Research
Network, 2018). Read through the suggested steps of the implementation process below. This
will guide the district in completing that long to do list in a structured feasible manner. 



Stages of Implementation
Scroll through to review the suggested steps of the implementation process. This will
guide the district in completing that long to do list in a structured feasible manner.

Step 1
Exploration
The exploration stage assesses the district's needs, the ﬁt of the proposed evidence-
based practices, and the practicality for implementation. If exploration leads to a
decision to proceed, installation planning commences. 
During this stage, teams may ask themselves:  
- What is MTSS?  
- What will it take to implement a comprehensive multi-tiered system of support
in our school or district?  
- How will we assess our readiness for change so we can eliminate barriers that
may prevent successful implementation?

Step 2
Planning
In the planning stage, leadership teams devise strategic plans to acquire necessary
resources for designing an effcient multi-tiered support system. This includes steps
like providing initial staff training and setting up performance assessment tools
before effective implementation can occur. Set up your infrastructure with
appropriate teams, data systems, and an implementation checklist. 
During this stage, teams may ask themselves: 
- What are our goals, and do we have a deﬁned action plan?
- What early professional learning needs to occur to build the foundation for
implementation?  
- How will we measure success?  
- How do we engage all stakeholders in understanding the relevancy of this work? 

Step 3
Initial Implementation
Next, schools and districts begin to implement a multi-tiered system of support. The
initial implementation phase sets the foundation for the ongoing MTSS process.
Several key activities and steps are typically undertaken to establish the framework
and begin providing targeted support to students including ongoing staff training,
developing intervention implementation teams, resource allocation, data collection
and analysis, tiered design based on data, curriculum adjustments, etc. The speciﬁc
steps and activities may vary based on the school's context, needs, and available
resources. After you have built capacity, try out the practices, learn, and improve. 
During this stage, teams may ask themselves:  
- What structures are in place (e.g., new schedules) to support early
implementation changes? 
- How do we support early innovators with robust scaffolds and supports such as
PD and coaching?  
- How are we using data to drive our work?   
- How much time is provided for early adopters to collaborate and reﬂect on their
new practices? (Senge & Kleiner, 1999). 

Step 4
Full Implementation
Full implementation is reached when 50% or more of the intended practitioners,
staff, or team members are implementing the identiﬁed strategies with ﬁdelity and
seeing strong outcomes for all students. 
During this stage, teams may ask themselves:  
- How will we scale up the professional learning options to meet the needs of the
early adopters as well as those just beginning?  
- How are we using data to reﬁne our system of support?  
- How do we maintain a focus on this work through transitions in leadership?  
After successful implementation, repeat the process with more partners, programs,
and practices! The MTSS process involves continuous monitoring, evaluation, and
improvement to support the success of all students.

Research (AIR) as your district begins MTSS

Already Have a Multi-tiered System in Place?
Many schools already operate with a preventive, multi-tiered approach to academic
performance (Response to Intervention) or behavior (Positive Behavioral Interventions and
Supports). That's great! This means there is already a foundation in place to integrate a
comprehensive school mental health system. That's right! The multi-tiered approach you are
using applies to mental health too. Here's how!
Implementing a Comprehensive Integrated Multi-Tiered
System of Supports
The MTSS framework is already structured to include policies and interventions that promote
positive student outcomes, prevent problem behaviors, and address factors that put students at
risk. Additionally, an effective MTSS offers early identiﬁcation and support for students who are
at risk of developing mental health issues. 
Integrating school mental health practices into an academic multi-tiered system involves a
systematic process that recognizes the importance of addressing students' positive health and
wellbeing alongside their academic needs. Click through the tabs for an overview of important
steps to consider in this process.

Assess the Current State –
Begin by assessing the current state of the academic MTSS framework and the existing supports
for students' mental health. This includes reviewing the data on student well-being, behavior,
and social-emotional needs, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of any existing mental health
initiatives or interventions.
Establish an MTSS Mental Health Team –
Create a collaborative team consisting of school administrators, teachers, counselors, school
psychologists, social workers, and other relevant stakeholders. This team will be responsible for
planning, implementing, and evaluating the integration of school mental health practices into the
MTSS framework.
Identify Mental Health Needs and Resources –
Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment to identify the mental health needs of students, staff,
and the broader school community. This assessment may involve surveys, interviews, focus
groups, or data analysis. Simultaneously, identify existing mental health resources and supports
available within the school or the community, such as counselors, therapists, or partnerships
with external organizations.
Align Mental Health Practices with MTSS Tiers –
Map out how school mental health practices can be integrated within the existing MTSS
framework. Identify speciﬁc strategies and interventions that can address students' social and
emotional needs at each tier of support (universal, targeted, and intensive). Ensure that mental
health practices are aligned with the academic supports already in place and that they
complement each other.
Develop a Comprehensive Plan –
Based on the needs assessment and alignment with the MTSS framework, develop a
comprehensive plan for integrating school mental health practices. This plan should include
speciﬁc goals, action steps, timelines, and responsibilities for implementation. Consider
strategies such as school wide positive health and wellbeing programs, individual and group
counseling, peer support systems, trauma-informed practices, and family engagement
initiatives.
Enhance Professional Development –
Provide ongoing professional development and training for school staff to equip them with the
knowledge and skills necessary to implement School Mental Health practices effectively. This
training may cover topics such as trauma-informed care, mental health literacy and awareness,
crisis intervention, and effective communication strategies. Foster a culture of support and
collaboration among staff members to promote a holistic approach to student wellbeing.
Foster Collaboration and Communication –
Establish channels of communication and collaboration among the mental health team,
academic MTSS team, and other stakeholders involved in supporting student well-being.
Regularly share progress, exchange feedback, and make data-informed decisions to strengthen
the integration of school mental health practices and continuously improve the overall support
system.
Evaluate and Reffne –
Conduct ongoing evaluations to assess the impact of the integrated school mental health
practices on student outcomes, well-being, and academic success. Seek feedback from students,
staff, and families to gather perspectives and identify areas for improvement. Use evaluation
ﬁndings to reﬁne and enhance the integrated approach over time.

With a strong commitment, schools can effectively integrate school mental health practices
into an existing academic MTSS, creating comprehensive school mental health practices that
support students' positive health and wellbeing alongside their academic growth. This
integration recognizes the interplay between mental health and academic success, promoting a
positive and inclusive school environment for all students.



The Interconnected Systems Framework: What the SBHA is All About!
The foundation for all the work of the School Behavioral Health Team at the University of South
Carolina is the Interconnected Systems Framework (ISF), involving an education-mental health
system partnership to add resources to schools from collaborating community mental health
organizations, and focused speciﬁcally on strengthening districts and schools' MTSS. 
Within an interconnected system, education and mental health leaders and practitioners have
time, space, and funding to plan together, combine resources, and use evidence-based
structures and systems to strengthen community practice.
ISF is a blueprint for building a collaborative mental health and education system. Download the
fact sheet below that focuses on the core features of the ISF approach.

The ISF in Practice
Take a few minutes and watch the video below explaining ISF and the value of integrating
mental and behavioral health supports. The speakers are Tami Morrow, Jennifer Nelson and
May Henry, all of whom are experienced working within the Interconnected Systems
Framework.
In an interconnected system, all children and families will be able to engage with well-matched,
high-quality educational, mental, and behavioral health programs and services more easily and
quickly than ever. The ISF blueprint grows and adapts with you, the young people, families,
dedicated practitioners, and researchers working with us.
It is the view of the SBHA team that MTSS is best operationalized by the Positive Behavioral
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) evidence-based tiered framework with emphasis on high
quality practices —  effective teams, data-informed decision making, screening and follow-
up to it, implementing and reﬁning evidence-based practices, and progress monitoring
across Tier 1 (promotion/prevention for all students), Tier 2 (early intervention for some
students, classroom supports), and Tier 3 (more intensive individual, group and/or family
intervention). Click here for more information about PBIS.
While in our view, it would be optimal for SC school districts to adopt the PBIS framework,
this is not essential as schools are able to embrace other aspects of effective MTSS
functioning. A critical factor will be having an inclusive and interdisciplinary team, ideally
including student and family voice, intentionally focused on improving the social-
emotional-behavioral functioning of students thus improving academic performance, and
systematically organizing and providing infrastructure for the MTSS. 
Integrating mental health practices into an MTSS is an
important step in promoting the overall well-being and
success of students. Click on the locations along the
roadmap for the basics of effective comprehensive
school mental health within an MTSS.
Commitment:
A successful integration of behavioral health services will require the commitment of district community
leadership teams that seek wide-scale adoption of comprehensive school mental health systems.
Funding:
Diverse and leveraged funding and continuous monitoring of new funding opportunities from national,
state, and local sources to support a sustainable comprehensive school behavioral health system.
Tiered System:
A full array of tiered, evidence-based processes, policies and practices, a MTSS, that promotes mental
health and reduces the prevalence and severity of mental illness by ensuring mental health and behavioral
interventions, just like academic instructional interventions, are available in varying intensities.
Resource Mapping:
Resource mapping offers schools and districts a comprehensive view of school and community services
and resources available to students and families. Having a systematic process that helps individuals better
understand specific details about the types of services offered, and how and when they can be accessed,
can improve student follow-through with services and coordination of care. You will learn more about
resource mapping in the Resource Mapping and Needs Assessment lesson coming up!
Evidence-based Practices:
Use of evidence-based and emerging best practices to ensure quality in the services and supports provided
to students.
Data-informed Decision Making:
Use of data to monitor student needs and progress, assess quality of implementation, and evaluate the
effectiveness of supports and services.
Screening:
Use of screening and referral as a strategy for early identification and treatment. We will discuss more
about screening later in this course! 
Well-Trained Educators and Specialized Support Personnel:
A full complement of school and district professionals, including specialized support personnel, who are
well-trained to support the mental health needs of students in the school setting. Teams also include
representation from mental health community partners working cohesively to broaden the availability of
support to students and families, enhancing access to mental health care. The roles and responsibilities of
community partners will differ based on unique resources and needs of schools, and are determined by
leadership teams.


We Are Here for You! 
The roadmap may be intimidating - building and sustaining an MTSS is no easy task! That's where the rest of this course comes in. As you progress, you will gain operational knowledge of the following MTSS practices: 
1. Using the Tiered Delivery System
2. Team-based Leadership
3. Resource Mapping and Needs Assessment
4. Data-informed Decision Making
5. Screening for Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Functioning

During the implementation of MTSS, schools must purposefully foster a sense of support and inclusivity for
all individuals. As such, to examine this further we included lessons in: 
1. Strengthening School-Family-Community-Partnerships
2. Cultural Competence in the School Setting

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- High-quality differentiated instruction: this component emphasizes the
importance of tailoring instruction to meet the diverse needs of students.

- Meaningful assessment, screening, and progress monitoring: To effectively
implement MTSS, schools need to have robust assessment systems in place. This
includes conducting universal screenings to identify students who may require
additional support, as well as regularly monitoring students' progress to determine
if interventions are effective. Assessment data can inform decision-making and
help educators identify the speciﬁc needs of students, leading to targeted
interventions.

- Identifying, selecting, translating and evaluating evidenced-based prevention and
intervention programs and practices: Schools implementing MTSS need to identify
and select appropriate evidence-based prevention and intervention programs and
strategies that align with the needs of their students.

- Professional development: Teachers and staff need training on topics such as
differentiated instruction, assessment and progress monitoring, mental health
literacy, selecting and implementing evidence-based practices, and intervention
ﬁdelity. Professional development equips and empowers educators with the
knowledge and skills necessary to support the needs of their students.

- Intervention ﬁdelity: As you know, implementing interventions with ﬁdelity refers
to ensuring that interventions are delivered consistently and as intended.

- Establish channels of communication and collaboration among the mental health
and academic MTSS teams: Regularly share progress, exchange feedback, and make
data-informed decisions to strengthen the integration of school mental health
practices and continuously improve the overall support system.

Addressing these core components establishes a strong foundation for implementing an
effective and sustainable MTSS. This comprehensive approach ensures that all students receive
high-quality instruction, targeted interventions, and the support they need to thrive
academically, behaviorally, and socially.
When done well, MTSS will have a positive impact on you, your
students, and your school community. 
Now, let's get started!

Theory into practice
Putting the MTSS framework into practice requires a systematic and collaborative approach
involving educators, administrators, support staff, parents, and the wider school community.
Now that we have covered the basics of an MTSS framework, let's explore its practical
applications.


Aligning Support With Student Needs
Aligning support with student needs within the tiered approach of the MTSS framework
promotes personalization, targeted intervention, effcient resource allocation, preventive and
early intervention, student engagement, and a positive school climate. By understanding and
responding to the unique needs of students, educators can provide the right support at the right
time, maximizing student success and wellbeing. 
Selecting Evidence-based Interventions Across Tiers
The number of available evidence-based practices can be extremely overwhelming. We will talk
in more detail about the term "evidence-based" in just a moment, but for now, let's look at
some strategies practitioners use when looking to choose the most appropriate ones.

Match the intervention with the current problem.:
Selected intervention should be designed for the identiﬁed problem. Special attention should
be given to evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention for your students and the current
issue to be addressed (Merrell & Buchanan, 2006). This means regularly assessing progress
to ensure that the chosen strategies are having the intended impact. 

Consider modular vs. manualized interventions.:
Manualized interventions with pre-made lessons can help take the guesswork out of
intervention planning and practice. Qualiﬁed staff can simply follow the lessons. However,
these types of interventions typically need to be followed completely. This can be time-
consuming, or it may not be feasible in some situations.  
Using modular behavior strategies have been found to help teams target speciﬁc issues and
combine strategies as needed. In a randomized control trial of a modular treatment for
children with depression, anxiety, and conduct problems, the modular treatment was more
effective than other standard evidence-based treatments (Weisz et al., 2012). A more in-
depth exploration of manualized vs modular intervention approaches for Tier 3 intervention
practitioners can be found in the SBHA "Growing Your Tier 3 Supports" course.

Compare open source vs. proprietary programs.:
Another concern when selecting interventions is cost. Proprietary programs can be
expensive and usually require instruction from their own trainers. The good news is there
are many evidence-based interventions that are offered at little or no cost! Using
interventions available in the public domain avoids expensive and time-consuming
trainings, subscriptions, and losing access to materials if the subscription is not renewed.

Once the MTSS team has selected interventions, the process does not stop there! Because MTSS
is a data-informed framework, teams can choose to change interventions if things are not
working as expected.
The Importance of Using Evidence-based Practices
It is the responsibility of the MTSS team to review the available evidence-based practices and
interventions that line up with the identiﬁed needs of the students. The term evidence-
based comes up a lot when we discuss MTSS. This means understanding and using
instructional practices, interventions, and approaches grounded in research that have
demonstrated effectiveness in addressing speciﬁc challenges while promoting student learning
and achievement. Watch this short video as Kelly Perales, Co-director of the Midwest PBIS
Network, explains more about evidence-based practices.
As Kelly mentioned in the video, evidence-based interventions are an important piece of getting
to the intended outcome for our students, whether it's to improve their school attendance,
reduce their depression symptoms, or teach them how to positively seek attention from adults
and peers at school. 
You also heard again about the importance of ﬁdelity, the degree to which interventions and
practices are implemented as intended. If intervention ﬁdelity is poor and students are not
making progress, it's easy to get frustrated and want to give up. Making sure there are solid
ﬁdelity measures guarantees accurate implementation of interventions and positive outcomes.
The importance of ﬁdelity in all aspects of the MTSS framework cannot be stressed enough. It
ensures that students receive the intended beneﬁts of the interventions and helps maximize the
effectiveness and impact of school-based mental health support. When interventions are
implemented with ﬁdelity, educators can accurately assess their effectiveness, monitor student
progress, and make informed decisions about adjustments or modiﬁcations.
Combining evidence-based practices with ﬁdelity within the MTSS framework ensures that
students receive high-quality interventions that have a proven track record of success. This
approach promotes consistency, accountability, and continuous improvement in supporting
the academic, behavioral, and social-emotional needs of all students.

Moving Through the Tiered System
Guidance at Each Level
Educators can better navigate the pathway to effectively meet the diverse needs of all students
by understanding the levels of support within the tiered approach. Let's take a short walk
through each tier of the MTSS framework and discuss the keys to optimizing educational
outcomes for every learner and pitfalls to avoid during implementation. 

Building the Foundation With Tier 1
The foundation of the MTSS framework is Tier 1. When your universal Tier 1 supports are
strong, most students are getting what they need. If there is a long line of students outside the
administrator's offce most days, that can be a clue that your Tier 1 may need more attention!
Perhaps the needs of the student population have changed, or there is a problem with ﬁdelity. In
any case, the MTSS team should review the data and ﬁnd out what needs to be addressed.
We all can agree that in every school "building a positive school climate is a central task and
involves the entire school community" (Bradshaw et al., 2009). For this to happen, Tier 1
activities must include programs that promote family and student engagement, cultivate
awareness and adherence to school-wide expectations, and incorporate practices to improve
overall wellbeing and alleviate stress among administrators, faculty, staff, and students.
Tier 1 activities happen consistently, not only in the classrooms but in a school-wide fashion,
with buy-in and support from school administrators. For example, some schools hold weekly or
monthly "town hall" style meetings. These can be a great way to bring the school community
together to discuss important topics such as mental health literacy and behavior expectations
while celebrating students who show positive behaviors. Think beyond a pep rally-style
gathering here. While we can have fun and create excitement about school spirit, we can also be
intentional about using evidence-based curriculum materials to teach positive social,
emotional, and behavioral skills.
If you are wondering how to fft these Tier 1 activities
into an already busy school day, check out the ideas
below!
- The morning meeting/advisory period are opportunities for intentional
community-building activities. Activities can include relationship-building and
sharing activities, reviewing classroom and school procedures, and mini-lessons
on character development and mental health literacy.
- School counselors can be a great resource for games and activities to use with
students.
- Talk with the media specialist about a related book to use during an English
Language Arts (or other content area) lesson. This is one way to infuse social skills
instruction into required academic content blocks. Time is our most precious
resource, so accomplishing two goals with one lesson is a win for everyone!

Consider including older students in the discussion, where developmentally appropriate and
with family approval. Students themselves can offer powerful insight into what they think they
need to be successful!

Implementing Tier 1 MTSS programming can be complex, and schools may encounter challenges that can hinder its effectiveness. Watch out for these common pitfalls of Tier 1 implementation.
- Tier 1 is more than hanging up a poster! While posters can be great instructional tools and reminders around our school building, they do not take the place of consistent, school-wide instruction with an evidence-based social skills curriculum.
- Tier 1 cannot be implemented well for your unique school population without planning. The planning stage is one of the
most crucial aspects of Tier 1. Your MTSS team is compiling data, completing a needs assessment, and thinkingcritically about the needs of
your students and families.
- Setting up Tier 1 supports is not a one-time task. As our populations and their needs change, so also
should we look at our data to see if the needs and interventions still fft. If not, our MTSS team goes back to
the needs assessment and makes changes based on the ffndings.

To address these pitfalls, schools should provide ongoing support and professional
development, establish clear expectations and guidelines, foster a collaborative culture, allocate
adequate time and resources, utilize data effectively, and ensure a sustained commitment to Tier
1 implementation. 


Tapping Into Resources
Implementing Tier 1 programming involves collaborative effort from within and outside of the
school building. By tapping into these combined resources, schools can effectively establish a
strong foundation for all students, promoting their well-being and academic success. 
Here are some insightful tips to help identify and effectively use available school community
assets as well as external community resources. 
Use the Resources Around You –
Don’t forget to build on all the resources in your school community. Support staff like your
school counselor, psychologist, and social worker often have great ideas to support the school
climate!
Seek Extra Materials –
School counselors usually have extra materials and information to support their guidance
lessons. For secondary students, school counselors can point you in the direction of other social-
emotional resources. Don't forget to ask for their help!
Keep an Open Mind –
Be open to the richness of the vast resources within the full school community. 
Stay in Tune with the Community –
You may also ﬁnd great resources outside of the school building via community partners (e.g.,
recreational centers, faith-based groups, non-proﬁts, businesses).
Essentially, a successful MTSS relies on a strong Tier 1 foundation to create a nurturing,
responsive, and inclusive educational environment that beneﬁts all students. By focusing on
universal supports, schools lay the groundwork for effective intervention, collaboration, and
continuous improvement, ultimately leading to better outcomes for students and the
sustainability of the MTSS framework. If you recognize that your school needs to build or
enhance practices at Tier 1, we've made it easy for you to gain more detailed information! Be
sure to take our SBHA course "Building the Foundation at Tier 1."


Bridging Supports With Tier 2 
A cartoon river and trees that says "Tier 2."
Now that your Tier 1 supports are strong and functioning well in your school, most of your
students are getting what they need. They are following school and classroom procedures and
making academic and social progress. However, you will have students who need additional
supports. This is where we provide Tier 2 supports.

Getting Tier 2 Support
Requesting assistance for a student who may need Tier 2 supports can come from a variety of
sources. Families, classroom teachers, or other school staff can reach out for support if they
have concerns. Other sources, like school discipline records or a social and emotional screening
measure, can also suggest that some students may need extra help. 
If the MTSS team believes a student needs Tier 2 interventions, the next step is gathering
baseline data. A staff member, usually the classroom teacher, gathers data on the concerning
behaviors of the student. This allows the MTSS team to know how the student's behavior looks
now and how it is impacting their academic and social skills. Sometimes, baseline data can be
surprising! The concerning behavior may need to be addressed, but at times the data shows us
that it is not as bad as we thought. Allow your team to go where the data takes you!
The most important thing to consider when referring a student to Tier 2 MTSS intervention is
the availability of the data that supports the need for additional support. It is imperative to
gather and analyze relevant data, such as academic assessments, behavior observations, and
progress monitoring, to ensure that the student meets the criteria for Tier 2 interventions. This
data-informed decision making process helps ensure that students receive the appropriate level
of support and that interventions are targeted toward their speciﬁc needs.
If the baseline data shows a consistent behavior issue that needs an intervention, the team can
select an evidence-based intervention and track the student's progress. When appropriate
supports are in place, progress monitoring should be fast and simple. You will ﬁnd more
information about progress monitoring in the lesson titled "Data-informed Decision Making."

Applying Tier 2 Strategies
Identifying a speciﬁc student need is central to choosing a corresponding support or strategy.
For example, small skill-building groups are one type of Tier 2 strategy used to address needs
ranging from social issues (e.g., friendship building), to family concerns (e.g., children coping
with divorce), to academics (e.g., work completion). 
What might this look like when put into action? 
At some schools, the school counselor may see a group of ﬁve students two days a week for
twenty minutes to teach friendship-making skills. The counselor may also visit classrooms or
recess to help students practice their skills in real-time. To collect progress monitoring data,
the counselor could ask the classroom teachers of the students to ﬁll out a quick electronic
form at the end of each day or week to rate their social skills.
Another example might be a school's use of Check-In/Check-Out (CICO). You might have heard
of CICO, a very popular and effective Tier 2 intervention. CICO is a structured system of daily goal
setting, data collection, and debrieﬁng.  
According to Filter and colleagues (2022), the 5 main practice elements of CICO are:
1. Pre-teaching with the student
2. Morning check-in
3. Teacher rating and feedback
4. Afternoon check-out
5. Home communication
You will have the opportunity to learn more about CICO in the Tier 2 course, but you can
download the following fact sheet from Vanderbilt University CICO resources for a breakdown of
the steps and a sample behavior chart.

Challenges When Implementing Tier 2 Supports
Take a look at some common issues with implementing CICO and other Tier 2 interventions.
Flip the ﬂashcards below for some strategies to address a few common pitfalls of Tier 2
interventions.
1. Not enough adult support: When thinking about stafffng needs for Tier 2 interventions, consider
helping students form relationships with other adults in the building.
Offfce staff, cafeteria staff, and other staff are all great choices!
2. Think beyond the classroom teacher: In some cases, classroom teachers may not be the best
choice to facilitate an intervention. For example, if a student participating in CICO
doesn't earn their reward, it may be hard on the student-teacher relationship. Another
adult may be a better choice to facilitate CICO.
3. Don't forget to have back-up: With so many stafffng issues, it's
important that we have back-up for our intervention facilitators. We
know consistency is best, so we want to be able to continue the
intervention even when some staff are absent for a day or two.
Let's connect with Cat Raulerson, trained school psychologist and part of Florida's PBIS Project,
as she explains where Tier 2 level supports ﬁt in.
As Cat explains, Tier 2 works in conjunction with Tier 1 and Tier 3. It is the important middle
ground so that students don't fall through the cracks.

Duration and Data-informed Decision Making at Tier 2
When we talk about intervention implementation and ﬁdelity, we
may wonder about the optimal amount of time for maintaining Tier 2
support before determining that there needs to be another course of
action. These next steps might include reducing support, continuing
with universal Tier 1 strategies, changing intervention that may not
be as effective, or increasing support with Tier 3 intervention. 
For academic interventions, state departments of education tend to
recommend 6-8 weeks of implementation before deciding to make
any changes. 
As you know, measuring behavioral skills is not as clear-cut as
measuring academic progress.
When looking at recommendations from U.S. state departments of
education, there is not much agreement on how long students should
stay in Tier 2 or 3, or how often we should collect data (Briesch et al.,
2019). When measuring behavior, remember that environmental
factors like time of day, how hard the student thinks a task is, and
peer inﬂuences can have big impacts. Data collection and review
might need to happen more often than it would when measuring
academic progress. The team can then use the data to decide on the
next steps. Here are a few ways this might look:
If the data shows the following:
TABLE HERE

Remember that this process doesn't have to go in a straight line! Although we
typically want to move from Tier 1 to Tier 2 to Tier 3, in keeping with the student's
data, there may be emergency or complicated situations where the team jumps to a
higher level of support. It's about meeting the student where they are. 

Where Do FBAs and BIPs Fit in Here?
Shifting our focus from academic interventions to behavioral interventions, we encounter a
distinct challenge in evaluating progress and determining the most effective strategies.
Functional Behavior Assessments (FBAs) are Tier 2 and Tier 3 tools where data is collected on
“ABCs” of the problem behavior (antecedents, behavior, and consequences). FBAs help us learn
what may be triggering the problem behavior and see things in the environment that reinforce
or make the behavior happen more often. Although FBAs are frequently conducted in schools
and are mandated under certain circumstances for special education students, there is little
guidance from most state departments of education on the required components for FBAs. 
In a survey of practicing school psychologists (Johnson et al., 2019), these were the most
common pieces of FBA data:  
Based on the FBA results, the team can come together to develop ideas about the function of the
behavior (e.g., attention, escape, etc.) and targeted strategies or interventions to address the
problem. Think about making an FBA a group effort for the MTSS team, rather than having one
person gather all the information. This makes the process more effcient and allows for
different perspectives on the student's behavior. As a result of the FBA, one intervention might
be a behavior intervention plan (BIP) that includes:  
- Adding environmental supports to prevent the problem behavior as much as
possible
- Teaching the student more appropriate replacement behaviors that have a similar
function (such as adult attention) to the problem behavior 
- Reinforcing positive behaviors
- Using consequences carefully to make the problem behavior less effective in meeting the student's needs

Tip: When developing replacement behaviors, think about what your students are
ready to learn. Often, students need to be taught skills that lead up to bigger skills.
For instance, if we want a student to play in a developmentally appropriate way with
others, we might need to teach them how to take turns ffrst.
To summarize Tier 2, it is for the purpose of identifying and responding to student needs in a
timely manner, implementing small group interventions, supplementing core instruction,
monitoring progress, fostering collaboration, and maintaining ﬂexibility. When a student
requires more focused support beyond the universal level, the MTSS framework process of
increased intensity at Tier 2 will contribute to reducing academic and behavioral diffculties. See
the complete Tier 2 course, "Bridging Supports with Tier 2" for more detailed information on
Tier 2 practices and resources.


Growing Your Tier 3 Supports
Tier 3 is our most intensive level of support. Interventions are individualized to reach students
who have not responded as we hoped to Tier 1 and 2 supports. At Tier 3, teams should look
carefully at what is driving a student's problem behaviors so the root cause can be addressed. As
we said earlier, an FBA is one useful tool to gather more in-depth information about student
behavior and the factors inﬂuencing it. 
At the heart of Tier 3 is individualizing our approach. Because students in need of Tier 3 support
did not pick up social and coping skills from the school-wide Tier 1 instruction or Tier 2 skill-
building groups, we need to go deeper and really tailor our intervention to the unique needs of
the student. The last course, "Growing Your Tier 3 Supports," will provide detailed information on
Tier 3 interventions and practices for the behavioral and mental health practitioners and staff in
your school and community.
Tip: Remember that students do not exist in a bubble! They are a part of families,
schools, and communities. Be sure to learn about their experiences and strengths.
You can build upon these skills while working on problem behaviors.

Communicating With Families About Students' Needs
Families might be worried about the amount of time it takes to carry out interventions and look
for progress. Families care about their children and want to see them do well. At times, their
worry may come across as frustration. Your school team may ﬁnd it helpful to include families
in decision making meetings to discuss intervention planning for their child. Involving families
also helps build collaboration between home and school as we work together to support
students' learning and behavior skills. Families can give input on: 
- what they think their child needs
- what works at home
- their child's likes and dislikes

Below are some effective ways to keep families informed about student progress. Click for
details about each suggestion. 
Behavior charts –
Track a child's behavior daily or weekly using a behavior chart. These can be paper or electronic.
You may wish to take a photo or make a copy of paper charts for the child's data collection ﬁle
before sending them home.
Electronic forms –
Electronic forms can be created and completed by school staff. You can share the data from these
forms with families via email.
Notes in the agenda book –
If your school provides agenda books, you can write families a quick note there. As with paper
behavior charts, you can keep a copy or photo to add to the student's data collection ﬁle.
Texts/emails/phone calls –
Texts, emails, and phone calls are all great ways to update families on student progress. Be sure
to check in with families about their communication preference so your messages reach them.
We should also include positive communications with families. A quick phone call or text to
highlight how a child handled a tough situation or used a new skill can be so powerful!
Tip: Automate reminders wherever you can! Scheduling alarms and calendar alerts
for yourself and your colleagues can help us be consistent with our communication
with families and each other.



Layering Tiered Supports
Balancing Support from Each Tier
When all tiers of MTSS are fully operational, there is a lot going on at once! Tier 1 supports are
always happening at the school-wide level to reach every student. For students receiving Tier 2
and Tier 3 interventions, there are additional layers of support happening for them, in addition
to the Tier 1 supports. Once a student moves to Tier 2 or 3, Tier 1 does not stop for them. The key
concept of the tiered approach is that supports are layered, and as students move through the
tiers, they receive increasingly individualized and intensive interventions while continuing to
beneﬁt from the foundational supports.
This approach acknowledges that students' needs exist on a continuum and may require
different levels of support at different times.

Teaming for Student Success
Clear and consistent communication about student progress is key to identifying any potential
issues and keeping the system running. We have to communicate with one another for MTSS to
work.
Regular, brief meetings including classroom teachers, administrators, school mental health
support staff (counselors, psychologists, social workers), and other interventionists are
incredibly important for sharing data, problem-solving as a group, and discussing the student
holistically. 
Below we have provided the Team Implementation Checklist (TIC; Sugai et al., 2011). It is a free
online tool to assess teaming structures in your school and identify areas of strength and places
to improve. Click below to check it out! We will also discuss teaming in much more detail in the
next lesson Team-Based Leadership!

Remember that MTSS in your district and school will change and evolve over time. As the needs
of students and families change, so will the interventions and implementation. Change is a part
of the process.  Listen to Kiana Longnecker, behavior support consultant, as she gives some
very encouraging closing remarks about implementing MTSS tiered supports.

Let's review the lesson.
- The tiered system of support emphasizes early intervention and support, ensuring
that students receive the assistance they need before challenges escalate. By
implementing MTSS, districts can create a responsive and inclusive educational
environment that maximizes student success.
- The practical application of the tiered approach involves continuous progress
monitoring to assess student performance and determine appropriate levels of
support. Data-driven decision making guides educators in identifying students who
require additional intervention and adjusting strategies accordingly. 
- Collaboration and coordination among educators, support staff, families, and
community resources are essential for successful implementation. Communication
and information sharing enhance the support provided to students, ensuring a
comprehensive approach to addressing their academic, behavioral, and social-
emotional needs. 
- All tiers of support within the MTSS framework are intended to work collaboratively
and complement each other to provide a comprehensive system of support for
students.

Together is Better
A Team-Based Leadership Approach to Implementing Core MTSS
It's always better to travel together. 
When you don't have to rely on yourself for everything from Point A to Point B, you get where
you're going faster and safer. That's why teams, especially among leadership, are a core part of
developing the MTSS roadmap. 
What does this mean practically? 
MTSS is not just about tiered interventions. It is about how all the systems (district, schools,
families and community) connect to ensure high-quality education for all students. 
A team-based leadership approach means building a strong team with a shared mission and
commitment. It involves bringing together important people from the school and community
who are affected by the outcomes in the school. These people are also known as stakeholders!
Stakeholders come together to talk about ideas, set goals, ﬁnd opportunities, solve problems,
and make decisions. 
The main goal of team-based leadership is to work together and achieve shared objectives. 
Within a strong, effective team, you can typically see three primary characteristics:
Consistent and Relevant Communication –
This approach includes coming together at the same time and sharing information with all
members. What is going to be done? How is it going to be done? What is the purpose of the
group's efforts? With a solid, agreed-upon vision the group is motivated individually and
collectively. Clear and transparent communication accelerates understanding and allows the
team to move forward with uniﬁed goals. 
Mutual Accountability –
Within a team-based leadership approach, roles and responsibilities are assigned collaboratively.
Effective teaming includes holding each other accountable and showing personal investment by
engaging, acting, and providing support. This accountability contributes to cohesiveness within
all systems and ensures initiatives are carried out with ﬁdelity. Accountability drives change. 
Shared Commitment –
The team is fully committed to identifying and solving problems. Those identiﬁed as "team
leads" have been designated with the authority to make sound decisions, act, and get things done
faster. It is key to have a team with the power to implement policy and procedural changes. 

The success of a MTSS framework within a school district relies on building a leadership team
that promotes thoughtful, effective, and sustainable implementation of MTSS practices
and strategies throughout a school district.
It is imperative that MTSS leadership teams exist at each part of the system (state,
district, and school building) and are committed to consistent, long-term implementation
of MTSS.
Let’s now move forward and look at teams at two distinct yet interconnected levels: the district
and the school.  




The District 
The Strong Foundation On Which School-Level Teaming Stands
While your school setting may seem like the starting point for teaming, teaming actually starts
at the district level! The district level team, also known as "District Community Leadership
Team" or DCLT, supports the school-wide teams through resources, policies, and open
communication!  
Think of your DCLT as the place you go to get the tools needed to build the roadmap. The unique
features of the DCLT is that it, and the individuals on it, have the responsibility to: 
- reallocate resources  
- change policy  
- sustain and scale the key elements of the MTSS
A DCLT is strongest when it is built on the principles of representation and collaboration. The
remainder of this lesson will provide resources and information to inform your identiﬁcation of
DCLT members and identify tools to support strong district/school MTSS collaboration. To
start, we will break down who is on the team before moving onto the functions of the team and
then how to implement those functions effectively.  

Who is on the DCLT?
Whether you are an existing member of a leadership team or a champion for MTSS in your
building, having a keen awareness of the functions of the DCLT is key as this team actively
supports and guides MTSS implementation efforts across all Tiers. An understanding of who is
on the team is the starting point for knowing what that team's function is!   
As the name implies, the DCLT includes representation from both district leaders and
community partners. A DCLT includes partners who have a shared commitment and can make
decisions that support positive outcomes in the schools and the community.  
You may already have a group that resembles a DCLT but call it by another name, and this is
totally ﬁne! It is always good practice to assess your existing resources and see how you can
blend or adapt them to the MTSS framework.  
To complete the mission, the team needs to have representatives from all key stakeholders.
Let’s take a closer look now! 

What is Meant by "Stakeholder(s)"?
In general, a "stakeholder" refers to any person or group who is positively or negatively
impacted by a project, initiative, policy or organization. They could be internal (people within
your organization) or external (people outside of your organization). In the implementation
of an MTSS framework, stakeholders are those most impacted by the outcomes. Diverse
stakeholders include district-level administration, school-level representatives, students,
families, and community partners.

Identifying and Recruiting Key Stakeholders
The composition of your stakeholder group will depend on the unique context of your school
community. Seek out individuals who can serve as champions and critical friends, who can
bring diverse skills and perspectives, and who can serve the school in a variety of capacities. 
The number of stakeholders should be large enough to include an array of perspectives, but
small enough for all stakeholders to make meaningful contributions to the process.
Think about the students that your school serves and make certain that the stakeholder
group includes representatives who can speak authentically to their perspectives and needs,
particularly those who have been historically marginalized (African American/Black, Latinx,
English learners, students with disabilities, etc.). 

Here are a few tips for gathering stakeholder input suggested by the Massachusetts Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education's Turnaround Practices. 

Turnaround Practices
Tip 1
Seek Input Early
Begin seeking stakeholder input early in the process of planning so that stakeholders
can make recommendations to inform the direction and priorities of your plan.
Tip 2
Conduct a Series of Meetings
Many districts and schools gather stakeholder input through a series of meetings,
which provides ample time for discussion of context, challenges, and opportunities. 
Tip 3
Facilitate
When convening discussions among groups of stakeholders, consider identifying a
skilled facilitator to guide the group's discussion and to document group
recommendations. Whenever communication is a barrier, there should also be an
interpreter available to support stakeholders not ﬂuent in English 
Tip 4
Share Meeting Information
It has proven to be important for meetings to include a published/shared agenda,
attendance records, notes/minutes, and a written set of recommendations, all
translated to support stakeholders who are not ﬂuent in English.
Tip 5
Employ Other Strategies to Gather Input
Teams may also choose to engage with stakeholders through focus groups, surveys,
interviews, or other methods appropriate to their context and needs.
Tip 6
Maintain Ongoing, Two-Way Communication
Stakeholder input should not end once a plan is written. Include stakeholders in the
vision-setting process. Identify ongoing opportunities to share information about
MTSS with the school community, and to receive formative feedback from your key
stakeholders as implementation progresses.

All Done!
Now that you have a better picture of who is on the DCLT, it’s time to examine the function of
the DCLT! 

How Does the DCLT Work With MTSS?
District administrators have a process to identify organizational readiness for implementing or
improving MTSS and/or integrating mental and behavioral health support into an existing
academic, tiered system. To ensure implementation, this process begins with an overarching
commitment to a strong and effective MTSS, clarity about the current status, and establishing a
focused mission.  
Work within the district team is focused on these 3 critical organizational needs (National
Association of State Directors of Special Education Blueprint, 2008):  
- Consensus: First, MTSS concepts are communicated to those who will be
implementing practices. This is where the “whys” are discussed and embraced.
Districts must then arrive at consensus regarding the importance of adopting and
integrating the MTSS framework and commit to the principles and practices that
guide implementation.  
- Infrastructure: Districts and their schools assess their existing practices/policies
against the essential components of MTSS, identify practices that are working well
and align with the framework, and address identiﬁed practice gaps. Infrastructure-
building focuses on closing these practice gaps.  
- Implementation: Structures and support are put in place to implement and
formalize MTSS practices with sustainability as the key consideration.
Now that there’s a foundation of who is on the DCLT and how the DCLT interacts with MTSS,
let’s move on to look at the speciﬁc functions of the DCLT. Before that, take a few moments to
reﬂect on the following questions:   
What leadership teams exist in your school district?
Are there other community organizations, state agencies, or
champions that could be added?
Are roles and responsibilities clearly deﬁned and in alignment
with a shared mission?
These questions allow you to assess the existing leadership teams and their collaboration
mechanisms in supporting student success. Considering the potential involvement of other
community organizations, state agencies, or champions can uncover untapped resources and
opportunities for strengthening your MTSS efforts. Evaluating the clarity and alignment of roles
and responsibilities among team members is crucial in fostering a cohesive and uniﬁed
approach, ensuring that everyone is actively working towards the shared mission of promoting
student success through MTSS. By engaging in this reﬂective process, you can identify areas for
improvement, enhance collaboration, and optimize the effectiveness of your MTSS team
leadership. 


What Are the Core Functions of the DCLT?
While each district has differences in the makeup of the leadership team, the primary functions
of the DCLT are often similar when the decision is made to adopt a comprehensive multi-tiered
framework. Let's look at a breakdown of district team responsibilities. 
In other words, let's look at what tools the DCLT offers in the roadmap creation process!
Stakeholder Support –
The DCLT creates opportunities for each partner to share their perspectives and knowledge on
academic, behavioral, and mental health needs and priorities, and to develop potential action
steps to advance the MTSS. The strength of the DCLT lies in strong, positive, and ongoing
collaborative partnerships.  
District leaders reach consensus and continuously advocate for policy change and funding
opportunities that can promote high-quality and sustainable school behavioral health. By
frequently communicating outcomes with stakeholders and celebrating successes (for example,
sharing innovative approaches to service provisions) the DCLT works to inﬂuence more
supportive policies and increases needed funding.  
When the DCLT can "communicate a clear, common vision and belief for intervention which
expresses a movement from compliance to commitment to the process as well as awareness and
support for resources needed to successfully implement and continue the use of interventions," it
builds a commitment in the community (SCMTSS, Framework, and Guidance Document, 2019). 

MTSS Alignment –
To ensure MTSS alignment across the district, the DCLT may set school team expectations for
interventions, data collection, and evaluation methods that assess and address student needs at
whole-school, small group and individual levels. 
The team guides and supports schools as they partner with families and community
organizations to integrate mental health services into the MTSS. The DCLT efforts promote
consistency across these contexts and areas of support for programming to be successful. 

Building and Strengthening Workforce Capacity –
The DCLT makes sure the system has the workforce necessary to implement and sustain the
MTSS by: 
- enhancing the existing workforce 
- expanding or clarifying roles and functions 
- investing in the schools’ infrastructure with support where/when needed 
- augmenting the existing resources and services available to ensure the work gets done 

Provide and Promote Professional Development –
The DCLT coordinates professional development so that all staff members are using common
MTSS language and strategies to support student academics and behavioral health and well-
being and provides additional instruction for educators and practitioners of students with more
intense needs.  
The district team will provide ongoing data-informed professional development activities that
align with core student goals and staff needs.  
Districts can develop standardized training for schools, encourage and advocate for access to
appropriate technology and its use, and provide ongoing technical assistance and resources. 
The DCLT provides overall funding and support for staff training including speciﬁc training in
school mental health topics and interventions. (SCMTSS, Framework, and Guidance Document
2019).

Coaching Support –
The DCLT utilizes systems coaching, a dynamic, supportive process to facilitate and assist the
district teams to build capacity to implement MTSS in alignment with district improvement
plans to enhance student academic and behavioral health outcomes. 
Click here for a "Systems Coaching and Leadership" fact sheet.

Evaluation, Feedback and Problem Solving –
The DCLT is responsible for decisions such as procedures for the evaluation of implementation
and outcomes. DCLT provides ongoing problem solving to support an effcient and effective
system. The team is responsible for regularly analyzing program information and making data-
informed decisions with a focus on continual improvement. 

What now?
The DCLT is in place with stakeholders identiﬁed and invited, and what the DCLT does when it is
fully functioning is established, so what happens next?   
You'll hear more about the difference between "engagement" and "inclusion" in the lesson,
"School-Family-Community Partnerships." For now, just know that the goal with engagement
is moving towards working "with" teammates and not "for" them. Engagement underscores
authentic partnerships with organizations, agencies, and nonproﬁt groups within the DCLT. 
All valuable collaboration starts with meaningful relationships. Building and strengthening
relationships begins with the coordination of teaming efforts. Creating a welcoming and
organized environment for community partners is critical for sustainability and progress
toward goal attainment.   
Let's watch the next video featuring Andrea Peyton, a
community health director and DCLT member, sharing
her experience and tips. 
As Andrea Peyton said, being a partner is a journey, not something that just happens. Take a
moment to download and review the DCLT Early Decisions Checklist below. This will help you
ﬁnd the guideposts of progress when creating or participating in a DCLT! 

Where are you in the Process?
In the very ﬁrst lesson, you reviewed the four stages of MTSS implementation: exploration,
planning, initial implementation, and full implementation. No matter where your school or
district is starting from, there is an implementation entry point—even better, there are
resources to help you ﬁnd it! 
Let's hear Ashley Greenwald, an assistant professor and Board Certiﬁed Behavior Analyst,
discuss the Initiative Inventory Tool, a free resource available to assist district teams exploring
MTSS in the video below!
Ashely describes the Initiative Inventory as “wildly helpful” because it helps schools
understand each different initiative and intervention, how it needs to be implemented, and how
it can be monitored. This is a great tool if you don’t know what your DCLT’s entry point into
MTSS implementation is! 
You have a good picture of team-based leadership and district-level responsibility to create the
framework and supports for schools in the implementation of MTSS. Now, let's explore
leadership teaming within the school buildings. First, a knowledge check!




The School Level
Fostering a Culture of Collaboration and Teamwork by Providing
Opportunities for Educators to Share Ideas, Strategies, and Resources
School level MTSS teams promote school-wide competence of multi-tiered practices and
interventions. Here, the roadmap is actually being created. To create a roadmap for MTSS,
school teams must examine a school's capacity and readiness, develop plans, create structure
and process, and conduct ongoing evaluation and review of efforts, with active involvement of
families and community partners in the work. 
This is the point at which a theory or idea is put into practice. The roadmap is actually being
created and then used. For the MTSS framework, the school-building is where it all happens.
The lion’s share of the MTSS work is carried out at the school level, but more importantly, it is
most impactful at the school level. The school team is the voice of the building to the district.
Let’s look at the roles and responsibilities of that team in greater detail now!

Roles & Responsibilities: School Leadership Team
Members of the teams should function with a shared vision for facilitating the MTSS. The
members should be representative of the school and community and lead implementation
efforts, including administrators, families, and school personnel who are skilled and
understand the multidisciplinary needs of the whole child— academic, behavioral, and positive
health and wellbeing. Click through the tabs below to read more about their roles and
responsibilities.

procedures. They also conduct frequent systematic data conversations with team
members.  
The principal: 
- oversees MTSS implementation in the building  
- makes sure there is a time during the day for staff to attend MTSS team meetings  
- ensures that the meetings occur regularly, and all relevant personnel are in attendance 
- attends MTSS meetings and/or selects MTSS administrator designee to 
		a. examine data and instructional practices at the Universal/Tier 1 level  
		b. facilitate problem-solving using school-wide data to guide instructional decisions

		d. communicate with DCLT, families, and the community 
- ensure that faculty and staff have access to relevant professional development
and technical assistance related to MTSS implementation 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 2
School Counselors
As a primary resource for administrators, teachers, and parents regarding mental
health awareness, school counselors implement school counseling programs
addressing the needs of all students. School counselors deliver instruction, appraisal,
and advisement to students in all tiers and collaborate with other specialized
instructional and intervention personnel, educators, and families to ensure
appropriate academic and behavioral supports for students within the school’s MTSS
framework. 
According to the American School Counselor Association, school counselors align
with the school’s MTSS by:
- providing all students with standards-based school counseling instruction to
address universal academic, career, and social/emotional development and
analyzing academic, career, and social/emotional development data to identify
students who need support
- identifying and collaborating on research-based intervention strategies
implemented by school staff
- evaluating academic and behavioral progress after interventions
- revising interventions as appropriate
- referring to school and community services as appropriate
- collaborating with administrators, teachers, other school professionals, 
 community agencies, and families in MTSS design and implementation 
- advocating for equitable education for all students and working to remove
systemic barriers

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 3
Teachers and Instructional Staff
Within the MTSS, all instructional staff: 
- provide high-quality standard-based instruction and interventions with ﬁdelity  
- implement selected schoolwide evidenced-based practices with ﬁdelity  
- collect data on the effectiveness of Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 interventions
(progress monitoring)  
- collaborate in problem-solving efforts to determine interventions and supports  
- implement strategies, support, and plans for small group and individual students
- ensure that appropriate data are provided to request assistance for students and
to use in problem-solving meetings  
 
continuously engage and inform parents of student progress 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 4
School Psychologists
School psychologists play an integral role in promoting and supporting competency
development within the core components of MTSS, including data-informed decision
making, evidence-based interventions, implementation ﬁdelity, and consultation
and collaboration (National Association of School Psychologists, 2020). In MTSS,
data-informed decision making includes universal screening of all students,
implementation of evidenced-based interventions at multiple tiers, and ongoing
progress monitoring to inform the decisions at each tier. A problem-solving process
supports ongoing evaluation of the data in order to make timely and ongoing
informed decisions (Gresham, 2007).  
School psychologists 
- attend DCLT and MTSS school leadership team meetings 
- contribute expertise in data interpretation and analysis, progress monitoring,
and effective problem-solving.  
- administer diagnostic screening assessments assist in observing students in the
- instructional environment assist in designing interventions matched to student
needs, based on data  
- assist with the identiﬁcation of appropriate interventions and progress
monitoring  
- consult with the school-based leadership team and school staff regarding MTSS
needs 
- provide consultation and support to the school throughout the problem-solving
phases 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 5
Community Mental Health Clinician
The school mental health clinician is a key member of both the MTSS team and the
school culture. Their visibility and voice on this team and throughout the building
communicates the importance of mental health across all tiers of the MTSS.  They
function as not only a referral source for students and families with more intensive
needs, but also as a consultant for wellness efforts across the tiers.   
School mental health clinicians: 
- attend all MTSS meetings 
-cprepare and report on qualitative and quantitative progress data on students and
families receiving intensive support 
- facilitate problem solving, offering key insights on the impacts and potential
root causes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors 
- identify and collaborate on research-based intervention strategies implemented
by school staff 
- support problem-solving and mediation for educators 
- lead and plan professional development related to individual and systems level
mental health and wellness strategies  
- facilitate small groups related to prevention, intervention, and postvention
support 
- continuously interact with and engage families at both the community and
individual level 
A barrier that is often encountered by clinicians in the school setting is lack of a sense
of belonging. For clinicians to be an effective teaming resource and not just a referral
source, there must be intentional effort to both educate them on the language of
education and the MTSS framework, while integrating them into the broader school-
wide community.   

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 6
Families
Parents and caregivers play a critical role in supporting what their children are
learning in school. Families and caregivers have valuable insights and information
about their children's strengths, needs, and preferences. They can provide critical
information to the MTSS teams about the student's background, interests, learning
styles, and any concerns they may have. This information helps the team create a
more comprehensive support plan.   
For children in Tier 2 and Tier 3 level supports, families should be involved in decision
making by being informed of academic, social, emotional, or behavioral areas that
may need to be addressed. Families should also be informed about how the child’s
progress will be monitored.  
Families can be involved in the MTSS process by communicating any concerns to the
child's teacher, providing insight into their child's learning and development, and
assisting with identiﬁed interventions at home. To participate, parents and caregivers
should have a clear understanding of the MTSS framework. To help families
understand what MTSS is and how it functions, it’s important to explain terms that
may be common to the school but unfamiliar in the home. Here are a few examples:
- Intervention: Consistent, systematic teaching and involvement with a student in
order to improve his or her performance academically, socially, or emotionally.  
- Intervention Plan: The components include an objective, what will be done, who
will do it, how it will be done, when it will be done, when it will be reviewed, who
will review it, and what will happen if the student makes or does not make
adequate progress.  
- Scientiﬁc, Research-Based Instruction: Curriculum and educational
interventions that are research-based and have been proven to be effective for
most students.  
- Universal Screening: A step taken by school personnel three times a year (i.e.,
fall, winter, spring) to determine which students are having diffculties that may
interfere with grasping grade-level instruction, and which students may be
exceeding grade-level. Students whose scores on the screening fall below or
above a certain cutoff point are identiﬁed as needing continued progress
monitoring and possibly more intensive interventions.  
- Progress Monitoring: A scientiﬁcally based practice used to assess students’
academic performance and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction. Progress
monitoring can be implemented with individual students, small groups, or an
entire class.  
- Problem-Solving/Leadership Team: A school-based team that meets regularly
to analyze student data, and to identify student learning and behavior needs in
order to develop interventions. The team, along with the caregivers, make
decisions to determine what intervention may be most appropriate for the
student to make progress.  
Data-Informed Decision Making: The use of data to guide the design,
implementation, and adjustment of instruction. 

Example Roles and Responsibilities # 7
Responsibilities of the School Leadership Team
To promote a healthy school climate, the school leadership team, like any leadership
team, should reﬂect the diversity of the staff, students, and broader community. In
addition, the team members should bring a diversity of skills and expertise to best ﬁll
out the responsibilities of different roles.

All Done!
Here is an example of a school district-developed MTSS team list including members, roles, and
responsibilities from Broward County Public Schools in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Download the
PDF below!

Phew! That’s a lot of roles and responsibilities. It can feel very overwhelming, especially if
you’re unsure of where your school currently sits with teams or if you feel overrun by teams in
your school already! Let’s look at this in more depth. 


School Team and Sub-team Structure
Many schools have team structures in place already, often curriculum and instruction teams or
school improvement teams. When building an integrated MTSS, communication is important
both within and between teams. We recommend having one Core MTSS Team and as many sub-
teams as needed by your school.  
A member from each sub-team should be a representative at the Core Team meetings. A sub-
team may work with specialized data to address speciﬁc concerns or plans, and these activities
reach colleagues and the district through the Core Team. The Core Team facilitates cross-
disciplinary collaboration. This structure is especially beneﬁcial for bringing multiple services
to students with complex challenges (without duplication) and for considering multiple
problem-solving perspectives on a single challenge.

Developing your school teams: Start where you are.
Identify existing teams in your school building that focus on academics, behavior, and positive
health and wellbeing. Build upon these existing teams when possible and consider recruiting
new members or restructuring a subcommittee from an existing team when needed. 
Otherwise, create necessary teams by engaging those individuals with the knowledge and
expertise to meet the school's identiﬁed MTSS needs.

You will notice that several school level responsibilities mirror those of the DCLT but through
the building level lens.
Keep in mind, one size does not ﬁt all. No matter the size, it is important to recognize what is
feasible in your individual school district and each school building. 
Remember, the MTSS mission in each school, regardless of the number of teams, is to:
- provide all students with an effective, preventative Tier 1 foundation of support 
- respond to student needs for additional supports by understanding root causes
- offer targeted interventions across academics, behavior, and positive health and
wellbeing
- bring data together—a system of exchanging and making effective use of data
- coordinate school-wide practices and expectations
Let’s now look at how DCLT and school leadership teams can work together after this
knowledge check! 


DCLT and School Leadership Teams
Working Together for the Betterment of All
For successful implementation of MTSS, it is critical to establish leadership teams at both
district and school levels. Both teams desire the same outcome: MTSS implementation
throughout their districts, schools, classrooms, and communities. Ongoing collaboration,
coordination, and communication between the school leadership and district leadership are
critical to ensuring that MTSS is achieving that outcome! 
While the district provides the overarching framework, the school leadership must be
responsive while moving forward to ensure that student needs are met, the staff is trained and
supported, and the identiﬁed components of MTSS are in effect. 
Let's look at the difference between the district and school teams more in depth now!

District and School Team Distinction
Take a moment to review the graphic below which
depicts the objectives for each team in a Venn diagram. 
Venn diagram depicting district and school leadership MTSS responsibilities 
As you can tell from the Venn diagram, there is a lot of overlap between DCLT leadership and
school leadership. However, they are still unique from one another! 
TABLE HERE
School and district leaders must continuously communicate and engage in ongoing study and
analysis of data in order to improve instruction, intervention, and assessment. When MTSS is
implemented with ﬁdelity, it is the students and staff who beneﬁt.
The above information was adapted from original materials provided by the Washington
State Offfce of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Original materials may be

Let’s move forward to some practical tips and resources you can use to maximize the
effectiveness of your teams after a knowledge check! 



Practical Tips for Teams
Making the Most of Your Time Together
Traveling with others, no matter how close you are with them or how well constructed the
roadmap is, can be diffcult. Complications arise, plans change, and sometimes attitudes or
behaviors clash.  
We know that teaming can be complicated. After all, teams are made up of multiple individuals,
coming together from different backgrounds, roles, and ultimate desired outcomes. It makes
sense that it would be diffcult! To help navigate teams and avoid potential complications,
review the following sections on effective team meetings and Team-Initiated Problem Solving
(TIPS)!

Effective Team Meetings 
Sometimes it may seem like there is a never-ending cycle of meetings. Too many meetings leave
staff exhausted and questioning, "what is the point?" Holding too many meetings leads to
discouragement and "meeting fatigue." Below are a few tips to help alleviate the stress caused
by meetings and ensure their effectiveness.  
-Meet Regularly: Create a consistent meeting schedule for your team based on the school's particular needs.
Regularly scheduled meetings on a speciﬁc day and time signal importance and encourage
attendance and participation. Consistency also promotes preparation and focus. 
Assign tasks: Depending on the primary focus of your team, roles within the team may look different.  Here are
examples of general member tasks and responsibilities that will promote smooth effective team
meetings: 
	a) Meeting Facilitator: Creates the agenda and guides the meeting process; manages
	discussions and decision-making activities. 
	b) Meeting Recorder: Records minutes highlighting decisions, tasks and actions.   
	c) Data Lead: Prepares and disseminates visual representation of key data prior to meeting.  
	d)Timekeeper: Moves agenda forward and watches time. 
-Prepare an agenda: Prepare an agenda and distribute it to the team in advance. Also, be prepared to display the agenda
for all team members to view during the meeting. Helpful features of an agenda include time
allotment for each item and team member names for those leading each discussion topic, if
different from facilitator. There should be time allotted for any new or unexpected information,
but before each meeting, members should identify and gather necessary materials to support
team decision making.   
In the next video, Principal Jordan Surdam discusses
how her school leadership team functions to get the
most out of their meetings through their MTSS efforts.
Now that you’ve reviewed how to have effective team meetings, let’s move on to examine how
we can be better problem solvers as a team!   

Team-Initiated Problem-Solving (TIPS)
If only problem-solving during meetings was an easy process! As you've probably experienced
yourself at one point, there are barriers to conducting effcient problem-solving meetings
including:
- limited time scheduled for meetings
- gaps in foundations (e.g., location, team members, procedures, the effciency of meetings)
- an unfocused or unidentiﬁed purpose for meeting
- inadequate training and support to implement effective and effcient problem solving
Solving the challenges that come along when schools are trying to improve outcomes for
students and practices for educators has to be done by using a data-informed decision making
process. Data-informed decision making is important because it ensures that the problems are
clearly and accurately identiﬁed, and speciﬁc targeted solutions can be applied. 
TIPS is a scientiﬁcally based approach for data-informed decision making. TIPS is applicable
for varied data sources, content areas (e.g., academics, behavior), and levels of application (e.g.,
school, district, state). 
The TIPS framework addresses barriers by breaking down problem-solving into six critical
steps to guide teams through a data-informed decision making process that leads to desired
outcomes.  
1. Identify a problem with precision: Teams identify who, what, when, where, why,
and current level for every problem that requires a solution  
2. Identify a goal for change: Teams set a goal that deﬁnes levels at which the problem
is no longer a problem  
3. Identify solution and create a plan: Teams brainstorm
solutions and decide what they are going to do to bring about desired change (i.e., meet their goal)
4. Implement the solution with high integrity: Teams implement and use data to
determine if they did what they said they would do  
5. Monitor the impact of the solution and compare it against the goal: Teams use
outcome data to determine if the solution is having the desired impact on the
outcome/goal  
6. Make summative evaluation decisions: Teams use ﬁdelity and outcome data to
determine what to do next

You can also use the attached link below to review the TIPS practice guide for data teaming and
making decisions. The guide was originally developed for the Center on Positive Behavioral
Interventions and Supports, and it provides guidance for schoolwide PBIS teams. However,
intervention coordination teams, student study teams, and other teams can use it as well.

TIPS includes recommendations on: 
- the foundations needed to organize and run meetings more effciently 
- a process for using data to identify school needs and goals for change as well as for
planning practical and effective solutions, and 
- a process for using, monitoring, and adapting solutions

As you can see, these videos put the theory you’d been reading about into motion! 
If you’re thinking about implementing the TIPS process, it is critical that teams are
supported by a coach who has been trained in the TIPS framework. They can facilitate the
ffrst two meetings, provide prompts and guides, and support the team by monitoring their
ffdelity and providing feedback. 
You’ve worked through a lot of material on teams! Be proud of yourself. All that’s left is a
knowledge check before the review, and you’re on your way to “Resource Mapping and Needs
Assessment”!

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- Teams at the district and school level are made up of stakeholders, such as school
administrators, family members and caregivers, educators, school psychologists
and more
- The DCLT’s responsibilities include ensuring MTSS alignment in the district,
increasing stakeholder support, allocating resources to schools as needed 
- The school leadership team focuses on, among other things, MTSS implementation
within the building, providing evidence-based interventions, and reviewing that
implementation is done with ﬁdelity 
- Effective meeting practices involves a regular meeting schedule, clearly assigned
tasks, and clear agendas; TIPS can also be implemented for extra support

Resource Mapping and Needs Assessment
Outcomes:
1. Describe the purposes and beneﬁts of resource mapping and needs assessment
2. Explore how resource mapping and needs assessment can advance school mental
health systems, including access to high quality programs and services
3. Reﬂect on a strategic abandonment tool for sunsetting programs that are not working

Resources in the School Setting
Illuminating the Path to Enhanced Student Support and Wellbeing
In the school setting, there are numerous resources available to support mental health. These
resources can be mapped, expanded, or reviewed as part of a resource mapping process for
effective behavioral health systems. 
Examples of these resources include school counselors who provide support and screening,
 school psychologists who provide assessments, mental health clinics and practitioners who
offer specialized services like therapy and psychiatric evaluations, peer support programs that
empower students to provide support to their peers, crisis intervention teams trained to
respond to mental health emergencies, and mental health awareness programs that reduce
stigma and promote mental health literacy. Additionally, community partnerships with local
mental health agencies, online resources and apps, support groups, and initiatives involving
parents and caregivers can also contribute to a comprehensive mental health support system in
schools.   
Visualize these resources with the table below. 
- School-based Mental Health
- Academic Enrichment Programs
- RBHS
- After School Programs
- School Counseling
- Tutoring
- Crisis Teams
- Support Groups
- Crisis Hotlines
By identifying and leveraging these resources, schools can build a strong foundation for
addressing students' mental health needs.

What is Resource Mapping?
Resource mapping refers to the process of identifying and cataloging the resources available
within a school or educational system to support students' mental health and wellbeing. It
involves systematically gathering information about the existing resources, services, and
programs related to mental health, both within the school itself and in collaboration with
external organizations or agencies.  
Resource mapping is a systems-building, expansion and review
process. There are many useful products that can be created during this
process. One of the most common products is a detailed "map" that
visually represents available resources (e.g., programs or services),
along with details about service features, accessibility, and associated
personnel. A comprehensive resource map should have information
about internal and external assets.   
Internal assets are resources available within the organization or system itself, such as
school personnel, programs, facilities, and policies. External assets are resources
obtained through partnerships with outside organizations, such as community clinics,
government agencies, universities, and parent/community involvement. 
Within MTSS, resources can be mapped across the tiers to better meet students' needs. It's
important to create resource maps speciﬁcally designed for students and their parents or
caregivers to address a range of mental health needs. Because resources and needs change, be
mindful to conduct resource mapping with some regularity. An annual review process is a great
starting goal.

Why is Resource Mapping Important? 
Thoughtful resource maps give school staff, students, and families a better understanding of
available resources and services! 
Having valuable resources strategically mapped can improve communication, collaboration,
problem-solving, and access to the most helpful programs and services. Resource maps help
teams avoid duplicating services, minimize confusion and stress for service users, and maintain
records of program or service usage, popularity, evidence base, and local outcomes. 
By strategically mapping valuable resources, schools can enhance communication,
collaboration, problem-solving, and access to the most helpful programs and services.
Resource mapping is invaluable for schools connecting or collaborating with external programs
and services, including social services, behavioral health services, and community programs. 
In order to embark on effective resource mapping, it's important to know where and how to
start. The following section will provide guidance on initiating the resource mapping process
and maximizing its beneﬁts within the school setting. 

Resource Mapping: Where and How to Start 
If you were just introduced to resource mapping for the ﬁrst time, you may be wondering how
or where to start. Consider the following questions as a starting point for your resource
mapping journey. 
Use the click-through picture to get a better look at
these questions. 
What are your goals and objectives?
Clarify the specific purpose of your resource mapping efforts. Are you looking to identify gaps in mental
health services, enhance collaboration with community organizations, or improve access to resources for
students and families? Clearly defining your goals will guide your resource mapping process.
Who should be involved?
Identify the key stakeholders who should be part of the resource mapping process. This may include
school administrators, teachers, counselors, support staff, students, parents, and community partners.
Engaging a diverse range of perspectives will enrich the mapping process and ensure comprehensive
coverage of resources. 
What resources already exist?
Take inventory of the resources that currently exist within your school or educational system. This
includes internal assets such as staff expertise, programs, facilities, and policies, as well as external assets
like community partnerships and available services. Documenting and categorizing these resources will
form the foundation of your resource map.
What resources are needed?
Assess the needs and gaps in your school's mental health support system. Consider the specific challenges
or requirements identified by students, staff, and families. This will help you identify the types of
resources and services that need to be mapped and prioritized. 
How will you gather information?
Determine the methods and tools you will use to collect information about available resources. This may
involve surveys, interviews, consultations with stakeholders, or research on existing programs and
services. Explore both online and offline sources to gather a comprehensive understanding of the
resources available in your school community. 
How will you organize the information?
Decide on the structure and format of your resource map. This can be done using digital tools,
spreadsheets, or even physical maps. Consider categorizing resources based on different criteria such as
type of service, target population, location, or availability. Visual representations, such as color-coding or
symbols, can make the map easier to understand and navigate.
How will you maintain the information?
Establish a plan for regularly updating the resource map to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Assign
responsibilities for maintaining and reviewing the information and establish a process for incorporating
new resources and removing outdated ones. This will help ensure that the resource map remains a
valuable tool over time.
By considering these questions and following a structured approach, you can lay the
groundwork for an effective resource mapping process. Remember, resource mapping is a
dynamic and ongoing endeavor that can lead to improved support systems and enhanced
outcomes for students and their wellbeing. 

Resource Mapping: A Dynamic and Customizable Process
Resource mapping is a process, meaning that it involves a series of systematic and organized
steps to identify, document, and analyze available resources. Resource mapping is not a one-
time event but rather an ongoing and dynamic activity that requires continuous assessment and
updating. 
The process of resource mapping typically includes activities such as identifying goals and
objectives, engaging stakeholders, gathering information about existing resources, assessing
needs and gaps, organizing and visualizing the information, and maintaining the resource map
over time. These steps help ensure that the resource mapping effort is thorough,
comprehensive, and responsive to the evolving needs of the school or organization.
The graphic below demonstrates a resource mapping process plan. Take a close look. What
might you add or change if you were doing this at your school or district? For example, if your
school already has a map for academic resources, you may want a planning step to review,
combine or expand the existing resource map!

A list of steps for resource mapping

Resource Mapping Practice Guides
Resource mapping practice guides provide valuable guidance for effectively conducting resource
mapping in various contexts. These guides offer step-by-step instructions, best practices, and
practical tips to support individuals and organizations in their resource mapping endeavors.
When you utilize these guides, you can navigate the resource mapping process more effectively
and maximize the beneﬁts of this strategic approach to identifying, utilizing, and enhancing
available resources.
Resource mapping encompasses four key practice steps.
Click on each tab below to investigate these steps in
detail.
Step 1: Pre-Planning –
Gather a pre-planning team. Choose team members with a range of leadership roles in your
school who can quickly identify critical needs and comprehensive resources. Key leadership roles
usually include administrative leadership, school psychologists, student services coordinators,
case managers, teachers, and mental health counselors. With your team, discuss your resource
mapping goals and create a plan to achieve those goals. 
See the Pre-Planning worksheet to help you structure your pre-planning meeting.
Step 2: Mapping Resources –
Meet with your goal-speciﬁc team (expand as needed). Begin mapping resources as relevant to
achieving your identiﬁed goals. The simplest way to start is to use a spreadsheet program such as
Excel or a table in Word (or other word processor). Digital resources are fast and easy to edit and
print out.
Check out the Categorizing Resources worksheet as a guide to visualize and organize your
information.
Step 3: Analyzing Resources –
Once you have organized, categorized, and documented your relevant resources, it is time to
analyze what you have found and create additional plans and products. When analyzing
resources, keep in mind your goals and consider all appropriate and available data.
See the Analyzing Resources worksheet to guide you in your analyses.
Step 4: Maintaining the Map –
Resource mapping is an ongoing process. It can be used to meet speciﬁc needs more effectively
and effciently over time. You will need to adapt your resource maps (and other products) over
time to meet shifting needs and optimize changing resources. The best resource maps are easily
accessible to all the students, staff, and families who need to use them. Resource maps can also be
instrumental for large-scale decision-making processes, funding, and equity initiatives!
Visit Maintaining Resources worksheet to help in maintaining your resource map.


Resource Mapping Across Tiers
Optimizing Supports for Student Needs
A great way for teachers and other caring adults to use resource maps is to review, select, and
connect with resources that meet their students' needs.
Do your students have their:
- behavioral health
- physical health
- relationship
- academic
needs addressed?
When you identify a student with unmet needs, you can use resource maps to address those
particular needs. For example, for academic needs, you might ﬁnd or create a list of tutors,
after-school activities, and academic enrichment programs. To avoid duplication of efforts, it is
best to communicate about existing resource maps during team meetings and at a range of
school community gatherings.

Enhancing Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) Using Resource Maps
Resource mapping across tiers refers to the application of resource mapping at different levels
or tiers within a system. In the context of school mental health, this typically involves
considering resources and supports available at multiple levels of intervention. 
Resources needed to promote mental health and behavioral concerns for all students should be
mapped at Tier 1. Greater intensity and more speciﬁc resources intended for only some students
can be mapped into Tier 2. The most individualized and intensive resources belong to Tier 3. 
Targeted Supports:
This tier focuses on resources and interventions for students who may require additional support beyond
the universal level. It involves identifying resources that are specifically targeted towards a subgroup of
students who exhibit specific needs or risk factors. Examples of tier 2 resources could include small group
counseling, social skills training, or targeted prevention programs. 
Intensive Supports:
This tier involves resources and interventions for students who require intensive and individualized
support. These resources are typically provided to a smaller group of students who have significant mental
health needs. Examples may include individual counseling, specialized therapeutic interventions, or
collaboration with external mental health professionals.
Universal Supports:
This tier includes resources that are available to all students as part of a universal approach to promoting
mental health and wellbeing. Examples may include school-wide mental health awareness programs,
positive behavior interventions, and school climate initiatives.

Organizing programs and services into Tiers and "layering," or offering services
simultaneously, helps to reduce the need for high-intensity services over time and match the
service intensity to the student need! 
Think about your school community's needs and the program's delivery capacity when placing
a program or service into a Tier. Do all or most students need this support at school, or just
some or a few students? Can the program or service accommodate the need?

Locating Resources
Locating resources is crucial for effcient utilization, meeting speciﬁc needs, avoiding
duplication, fostering collaboration, and making informed decisions. It ensures resources are
allocated effectively, provides timely access to necessary support, focuses efforts where gaps
exist, enables partnerships, and supports effective planning. Overall, resource location
optimizes resource utilization and enhances the ability to meet the needs of individuals and
communities. 
There are various ways to locate different services and supports. Please visit the links below to
aid you in locating resources. 



Needs Assessment in the School Setting 
Examining the Current Landscape
Needs assessment plays a crucial role in the realm of school mental health as it provides a
systematic and comprehensive approach to understanding the speciﬁc needs and challenges
faced by students. Conducting a needs assessment in the school setting allows educators,
administrators, and mental health professionals to gain valuable insights into the unique
mental health needs of students while enabling them to develop targeted interventions and
support systems. This process involves collecting and analyzing data to identify the prevalent
mental health issues, risk factors, and protective factors within the school community. 
Through a collaborative and evidence-based approach, needs assessment in the school setting
paves the way for the implementation of effective interventions that address the mental health
needs of students, promoting their overall wellbeing and academic success. 

What is a Needs Assessment? 
A needs assessment is a collaborative process that aims to identify and address challenges and
gaps within an organization, enabling a better understanding of the areas where improvement
or support is needed. Identifying pressing needs can inform quality improvement activities,
intervention selections, resource allocation, and professional development choices in schools,
districts, and state education agencies.
"Assessment is the process of collecting data to make
decisions” (Salvia & Ysseldyke, 1998). 
As stated by Professors Salvia and Ysseldyke, in the context of school mental health, a needs
assessment serves as a comprehensive approach to gathering data and informing decision
making. 
A school conducts a needs assessment to understand the mental health needs of students. The
process begins with gathering data through surveys, interviews, and focus groups involving
students, parents, teachers, and staff members. The assessment examines various aspects,
such as students' emotional wellbeing, prevalence of mental health concerns, access to support
services, and perception of school climate. Based on these ﬁndings, the school identiﬁes
speciﬁc areas for improvement.  
The needs assessment provides valuable insights for the school to develop targeted
interventions, allocate resources effectively, and collaborate with community partners to
address the identiﬁed needs. Regular assessments allow the school to monitor progress, make
necessary adjustments, and ensure continuous improvement in supporting the mental health
needs of their students. 

Assessment Continuation: Comprehensive Evaluation Over
Time in the School Setting 
Assessments are done over a period of time, also called a continuation. A continuation of
assessments within a school could include administrative data review, screening, progress
monitoring, and evaluation. 
Click through the picture below to learn more about the
continuation of assessments. 
Screening:
In the needs assessment process, screening involves conducting school-wide screenings to identify
students who may require additional support. This could include screening for academic, behavioral,
social, or emotional concerns. When schools assess who is and is not responding to the initial supports
provided, they can gain insights into the effectiveness of their interventions and identify areas that require
further attention. 
Progress Monitoring:
Progress monitoring is an essential component of needs assessment. It involves regularly assessing the
effectiveness and fidelity of the interventions (meaning the degree to which intervention is implemented
as originally designed or intended) implemented for students. This could include tracking students'
academic progress, behavioral changes, social, or emotional development over time. Monitoring progress
guides schools to make data-informed decisions, adjust interventions as needed, and ensure that students
are making meaningful gains.
Evaluation:
Evaluation is a crucial aspect of needs assessment that focuses on assessing the overall effectiveness of the
initiatives and interventions implemented within the school. It involves analyzing the data collected,
examining the outcomes achieved, and evaluating the impact of the implemented strategies. Conducting
comprehensive evaluations helps schools to determine the success of their efforts, identify areas of
improvement, and inform future decision-making to better meet the needs of their students.

Beneﬁts of Conducting Needs Assessments 
Conducting needs assessments in the school setting offers several beneﬁts. These assessments
help identify areas of improvement by systematically gathering data and pinpointing gaps in
resources and services. They also allow schools to tailor interventions and support based on the
speciﬁc needs of students, leading to more effective strategies. Needs assessments inform
decision-making by providing data-driven information and help schools allocate resources
more effciently. They promote collaboration among stakeholders and encourage partnerships
for meeting student needs. Additionally, needs assessments help monitor progress, evaluate
outcomes, and drive continuous improvement. Overall, conducting needs assessments
enhances the understanding of challenges, informs targeted interventions, and improves
outcomes for students.
A compass on top of a map
Conducting a schoolwide needs assessment allows you to: 
- identify challenges experienced by most or all students, indicating a need for Tier 1
 programming improvements 
- monitor student progress and growth collectively and for speciﬁc social groups (e.g., by
 age, race, ethnicity, special education, or language status) 
- balance needs and resources equitably 
- set goals for resource mapping and systems-building efforts
Having discussed the beneﬁts of conducting needs assessments in the school setting, it is
crucial to reﬂect on the importance of having a needs assessment speciﬁcally for mental health
in schools. Mental health plays a signiﬁcant role in students' overall wellbeing and academic
success. Understanding and addressing their mental health needs is essential for creating a
supportive and nurturing learning environment. A needs assessment for mental health allows
schools to identify speciﬁc challenges and gaps in mental health support services. It helps in
tailoring interventions and resources to meet the unique needs of students, ensuring that
appropriate and effective mental health support is provided. 
Now, let's take a minute to consider the mental health
needs of students with the reffection questions below. 
- How can a needs assessment for mental health help schools identify and prioritize speciﬁc
 mental health needs among students? 
- In what ways can a needs assessment contribute to the development of tailored and
 effective mental health interventions and support services? 
- How can a needs assessment for mental health foster collaboration and partnerships with
 external agencies and community resources to enhance the overall mental wellbeing of
 students? 
What are some potential challenges or barriers that schools may face when conducting a
needs assessment for mental health, and how can they be addressed? 
By contemplating these questions, you can gain a better understanding of the signiﬁcance of
needs assessments in addressing the mental health needs of students in schools and fostering
a supportive and inclusive learning environment.




Exploring Classroom-Level Needs Assessments 
Distinguishing Whole School and Classroom Needs Assessments
When conducting a needs assessment, it's important to understand the distinction between
assessing the needs of an entire school and assessing the needs of a speciﬁc classroom. While
both approaches share the goal of identifying areas of improvement, they differ in their scope
and focus. 
A whole school needs assessment involves gathering information and data from various
stakeholders across the entire school community, including administrators, teachers, support
staff, students, and parents. This comprehensive assessment aims to capture the broader
needs, challenges, and priorities of the entire school. It provides a holistic view of the school's
strengths and areas for growth, allowing for the development of targeted strategies and
interventions at the school-wide level.
On the other hand, a classroom needs assessment focuses speciﬁcally on assessing the needs
and learning requirements of a particular classroom or group of students. It involves gathering
information about the speciﬁc strengths, weaknesses, and individual needs of students within
that classroom. This type of assessment allows teachers to tailor their instruction, differentiate
learning activities, and provide appropriate support and resources to meet the diverse needs of
their students. 
While a whole school needs assessment provides a big picture view and informs school-wide
initiatives, a classroom needs assessment enables teachers to address the unique needs of their
students in a targeted and individualized manner. Both approaches are valuable and
complement each other in creating a supportive and responsive learning environment. 

Tips for Developing a Needs Assessment 
Embarking on a needs assessment journey is a crucial step towards understanding the
challenges and opportunities within a school community. Developing a comprehensive needs
assessment requires careful planning, thoughtful consideration, and a commitment to
gathering meaningful data. This section will provide you with valuable tips and insights to guide
you through the process of creating an effective needs assessment. By applying these strategies,
you will be better equipped to identify the unique needs of your school, gather relevant
information, and lay a solid foundation for informed decision-making and positive change.
Let's explore the key tips for developing a needs assessment and unlock the potential of your
school. 
When developing a needs assessment, there are several
topics and data sources that you should include. Here
are some meaningful topics to consider. 
- Student stressors and mental health concerns 
- Student academic progress 
- Student, family, and teacher knowledge of school mental health   
- Student and family satisfaction with the mental health services in the school
- Student relationship quality with school staff and peers
- Offce disciplinary referrals
- Attendance data
As you delve into the meaningful topics and data sources outlined here, you will gain valuable
insights that can drive evidence-based decision-making and foster a supportive and thriving
learning environment. Embrace the power of a well-crafted needs assessment and pave the way
for a brighter future for your school.

Sources of Data for a Comprehensive Needs Assessment 
Data for a needs assessment should come from many sources. There are various types of
assessments to evaluate students’ performance and effectiveness of support. There are four key
sources of data to inform your overall assessment: summative assessments, universal
screeners, progress monitoring, and formative assessments. Let’s examine each one of these.

Empowering Students Through Thoughtful
Assessment and Support 
Guiding Students Toward Success with Compassionate Evaluation
and Strengthening Care
Empowering students to reach their full potential requires a comprehensive approach that
encompasses thoughtful assessment and support. You will now explore best practices for
assessing student mental health needs and strengths. By conducting thorough needs
assessments, educators can gain a deep understanding of students' unique challenges and
strengths, paving the way for tailored interventions. Additionally, it is essential to regularly
evaluate and reassess programs and initiatives to ensure their effectiveness. This section also
emphasizes the importance of sunsetting programs that are no longer serving their intended
purpose, making room for innovative approaches. Let’s get started! 
Best Practices for Assessing Student Mental Health Needs
and Strengths
So far, you have reviewed key assessment types, frequency, and participants in a schoolwide or
classroom needs assessment. You may be wondering about best practices in assessing student
mental health needs.  
Assessing student mental health strengths is a vital component of promoting overall wellbeing
and resilience among students. While identifying and addressing mental health challenges is
crucial, it is equally important to recognize and cultivate the strengths and positive attributes.
Knowing the strengths of students and staff as well as available resources will help you identify
the most effective and effcient improvement goals. 
You will now explore best practices for assessing student mental health needs and strengths. 
See the process plan outlined below for assessing
student mental health needs and strengths.

Let’s put these best practices into action! You will now have the opportunity to conduct a mental
health needs assessment using the questions provided below. This will allow you to apply your
knowledge and skills in evaluating student mental health needs and strengths.
Review and answer the following questions as a guide
for conducting a mental health needs and strengths
assessment in your school.

Questions to complete conducting a needs assessment activity
It is important to note that these questions should be used as a guide and can be adapted based
on the speciﬁc context and needs of the students being assessed.  

Sunsetting Programs That Are Not Working
There may be times when assessment data reveal that existing programs or interventions are
ineffective or no longer working. This could be due to several reasons. For example, they may
not align with the speciﬁc needs of students, suffer from a lack of necessary resources, be
inﬂuenced by changing circumstances, rely on outdated strategies or approaches, lack ongoing
evaluation and monitoring, or lack stakeholder engagement. When assessment data reveal that
a program or intervention is ineffective, a thorough evaluation is necessary to identify the
reasons behind its ineffectiveness. This evaluation process can provide valuable insights for
making informed decisions about program adjustments, redesign, or the need for alternative
interventions that better meet the evolving needs of the students. 
In situations like these, review:
the evidence base for the program or intervention
staff buy-in and ﬁdelity with which it is delivered
the match (or mismatch) to your student or school needs
If any of these elements is missing or cannot be addressed, you should consider sunsetting (or
exiting) the program or intervention used in your school.
See a strategic abandonment assessment tool below (developed by the Ector County
Independent School District) to reﬂect on additional considerations for sunsetting a program
or intervention.

Let's review the lesson.
- In the school setting, there are numerous resources available to support mental
health, including school counselors, psychologists, mental health clinics, peer
support programs, crisis intervention teams, mental health awareness programs,
community partnerships, online resources, support groups, and initiatives
involving parents/guardians. 
- Resource mapping is the process of identifying resources. It is important as it
improves communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and access to the most
helpful programs and services, avoids duplicating services, minimizes confusion
and stress for service users, and helps maintain records of program or service
usage and outcomes. 
- The needs assessment process involves data collection and analysis to identify
prevalent mental health issues, risk factors, and protective factors. 
Needs assessment provides valuable insights into the needs and strengths of
students, enabling targeted interventions and support systems.

Data-informed Decision Making 
Taking Advantage of Data
Data sources on table
There is a great deal of data available for teachers, schools, and districts. Think about it! You
have grades, end of the year percentages, results from screeners, offce discipline, referrals—
and that’s not all! A large volume of data may be overwhelming, though, especially when trying
to make decisions.
It is common to feel lost about when to use data, which data to use, and how to make data-
informed decisions. 
In this lesson, the goal is to demystify data-informed decision making processes using the
MTSS framework.

What is Data-informed Decision Making?
Data-informed decision making is the process of using data to understand and meet needs. This
means analyzing the various sources of data that are available, looking for patterns, identifying
problems, and using this enhanced understanding to decide on what next steps will be most
beneﬁcial.  
Data can sound intimidating – however, data is just information. Decisions are made based on
data all the time in everyday life, even if you may not realize it. You may make a data-informed
decision when you: 
- Leave work at 6 PM because when you left at 5 PM yesterday, traffc made it take
twice as long to get home
- Eat at the restaurant that has a 5-star average review on Yelp instead of the
restaurant that has a 2-star average
- Purchase a car that has a higher miles-per-gallon rating to save money on gas
As you can see, data-informed decisions happen around
us all the time. Let's look at what this looks like in the
school setting.
Data collection is the ﬁrst step toward data-informed decision making. School systems
collect and maintain data for administrative, accountability, instructional, and support
service purposes.
Decisions that are informed by data in a structured and transparent process are more likely
to be effective, equitable, and effcient in supporting high quality student outcomes than are
other types of decision making.
Data-informed decision making processes can take a lot of time and thought, especially in
the early stages of data use. Persistence will pay off when you begin to see signiﬁcant positive
impacts on students’ academic, mental health, and overall wellbeing!
In MTSS, data is not about adding more to your plate. Instead, it is about ensuring that
you have the right nutrients on your plate when you need them.

Why Make Data-informed Decisions?
Now that we have more information about what data-informed decision making is, let's look at
how it is useful in the school setting. Let's start by reviewing this video about why data is so
important in the school setting. 
Why is data and data-based decision making such a critical part of……
Why is data and data-based decision making such a critical part of
As Dr. Little described in the video, data is a powerful tool used by teachers and other school
staff to identify student needs. Research demonstrates that data-informed decision making is
effective in improving student outcomes (Faria et al., 2017). 
Review the chart below for information on some of the
beneffts of data-informed decision making. 
- Providing information on student strengths –
Often, data is associated with looking for weaknesses or problems in the student population.
However, it is not just important to use data to identify students in need of support, but also to
learn about the unique strengths that students possess. 
- Reducing biases or inequities –
Using data to make decisions can provide objective measures to reduce any bias or inequity that
may exist. Data can also be used to determine when inequity is present.
- Making instructional time more efffcient –
Data can help teachers determine areas of strength and weakness in their classes and determine
which instructional methods may or may not be working for a particular group of students. This
can help them customize instruction as needed, adapting to the needs indicated by data.
- Increasing effectiveness of interventions –
Data can improve the effectiveness of interventions by ensuring that students are matched
appropriately and by measuring how well the intervention is going. With this knowledge,
practitioners can make decisions that increase their effectiveness and improve student
outcomes. 
- Providing students with the right fft when needed –
Ultimately, the goal of data-informed decision making is to ensure that students receive the right
support at the right time in order to meet their unique needs. Data gives us the information
needed to make these decisions.
What's my role?
Now that we know the power of data-informed
decisions, take a moment to consider how you
are (or could be) making these decisions in your
role.
There are many ways that you may participate in your school's process of data-informed
decision making. Here's a short list to get you started, but there are many, many others: 
- Use the scores from a pre-test given to your class to determine what to cover in the
next unit
- Use attendance records to determine which students in class are at-risk for falling
behind or dropping out
- Interpret universal screening results on an MTSS team
- Use progress monitoring to determine how an intervention is going
- Use behavior data (number of detentions, offce referrals, etc.) to determine if
students are in need of Tier 2 or Tier 3 support
- Keep going with this lesson for more examples and more information on this process!




Getting Started with Data-Informed Decision
Making
The First Step
The ffrst step in making decisions based on data is
ffnding data. Let's review some common sources of data
that you may have access to. 
Academic Assesments: Assessment data include universal screeners (e.g., Kindergarten
Readiness Assessment and reading screeners), progress monitoring
data, curriculum-based assessments, as well as grades and
daily assignments. 
Behavioral data: Behavioral data can come from behavioral assessments or
administrative sources such as offfce discipline referrals and visits
to the counselor, social worker, or nurse.
Attendance Records: Attendance data may be useful
in detecting barriers to student learning and success.
School Surveys: Survey data may be collected and available about students'
perceptions of the school climate, safety, and other topics
Community data: Community data include demographic characteristics such
as racial and ethnic composition, and community challenges such as
poverty, violent crime rates, prevalence of substance use
disorders, calls to crisis centers, and hospital visits
Social and emotional data: Social and Data from social, emotional, and
behavioral surveys and screeners are helpful for understanding
student risks and skills. More specialized mental health and
trauma screener data may be used as well.
These data sources may seem overwhelming. They can
also be broken down into categories: academic,
behavioral, and social-emotional. Review the graphic
below for examples.

Graphic demonstrating different sources of data
With all of the information available, it's also important
to know what resources are available for collecting and
storing data. Below are examples of data collection and
interpretation structures. Click for more information.
Think about which of these you have access to and use in
your work.
Apps: Software for specific or special types of data analysis, reports, and communications
Spreadsheet Templates: Computer spreadsheet software for data entry set up to automatically make calculations or analyze data
Time: Protected time for data collection, analysis, and interpretation
Team Meetings: A space and time to interpret data
Community/Family Nights: A space and time to collect and/or interpret data
Social Media: Communication tool for collecting some types of data and sharing results
PowerSchool: Software to enter, retrieve, and analyze data
Shared Drives: Cloud drives or hard drives multiple team members can access

Utilizing Data: Progress Monitoring
Making Informed Decisions
Sources of data have been identiﬁed, so what's next? Let's review how to make the best use of
our data through progress monitoring. 
Progress monitoring is the process of setting goals and measuring their progress over time.
Progress monitoring can be used to support any type of academic, behavioral, or social-
emotional goals. There are three phases of progress monitoring that we will examine here.
Review the list below.
1. Goal setting
2. Visualizing progress
3. Measuring ﬁdelity

1. Goal Setting:
The ﬁrst step when monitoring progress is to determine what we are looking for. Using
baseline assessments can help inform what goals you want to set for your students and
determine what target outcome is being worked towards. 
No matter the target outcome, the team should take care to develop student goals that are
speciﬁc, measurable, and realistic for the student. You may have heard of SMARTIE goals. This
goal development technique has been applied to many behaviors, from workplace productivity
to ﬁtness to education. Using SMARTIE goals can help us be systematic with goal development
and, in turn, progress monitoring. 
Specific –
Your goal should be speciﬁc. Deﬁne the goal you are measuring in a clear, concise way. When
goals are related to behavior, use language that refers to the observable characteristics of the
behavior. For example, instead of setting the goal that “Julia will be less hyperactive,” be speciﬁc
about the behaviors Julia exhibits, such as tapping her pencil, getting out of her seat, and
wandering around the classroom. When forming a goal, also include any relevant information,
such as setting or time of day. A speciﬁc goal may be something like, "Julia will reduce her
pencil-tapping behavior in her classes." 
Measurable –
Be sure that you can measure the target behavior! This can get tricky with some internalizing
issues, like depression. One option is measuring symptoms with a standardized rating scale. You
could use something speciﬁc, like the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), or a general rating
scale, like the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-3). To continue our example with
Julia, we can measure the frequency with which she taps her pencil. We could add to our goal:
"Julia will reduce the amount of pencil-tapping behavior from 10 to 2 times per class." 
Achievable –
Goals should be challenging but attainable for students. We always want to set them up for
success. Goals can always be increased or adjusted if they are met quickly. This is a good problem
to have! 
Realistic –
Here, consider what is a reasonable amount of change for your time frame. Behavior issues are
rarely resolved quickly. Think progress over perfection. Maybe a student with social anxiety sat
on the edge of the carpet during her 3rd grade class's morning meeting. This could be an
improvement from sitting at her desk, away from the group. 
Timely –
Identify the time frame for achieving the goal. Include not only the projected achievement date,
but also how often progress will be monitored and by whom. Being clear about these details can
be helpful for intervention implementation, ﬁdelity, and timely data collection. For example, we
can set a speciﬁc timeline: "Julia will reduce her pencil-tapping behavior from 10 to 2 times per
science class by the end of this month." 
Inclusive –
When setting goals, think about inclusivity, or how we can bring marginalized people into our
decision making and procedure development. Consider not only your students, families, and
school staff, but the community at large.
Equitable –
Lastly, think about the fairness of your goal. What are some ways to incorporate restoration and
justice?

Review the flashcards below for some example goals you
may work with students to achieve. 
Attendance:Reduce number of absences, Reduce number of tardies or
early dismissals,Increase overall amount of time at school each day
Behavior: Reduce the amount of time between teacher's
instructions and when the child begins their work, Increase the amount of on-
task behavior during whole group instruction, Increase the amount of on-
task behavior
Anxiety: Increase school attendance, Increase use of calming
strategies during high-stress situations, Increase positive social
interactions with peers, Decrease escape behaviors (leaving the classroom)

Gathering Additional Information
To support these goals, you may need to gather additional information. Using anxiety as an
example, the team would likely need to gather additional information on what appears to trigger
anxiety at school. Are there certain times of day, settings, or other factors that seem related to
their experience of anxiety? How does anxiety look for this student? These are all important
questions to consider so the team can select an intervention that meets their needs. 
Using attendance as an example, we would likely need to support the entire family rather than
just the child. In addition, intervention for attendance would likely look different for an
elementary school child than a high school student who might drive themselves to school.

Visualizing Progress
After goals are set, the next step is to determine if the goal is being met and if progress is being
made. An effcient and practical way to detect district, school, group, or student progress is to
graph the data using a bar or line graph. This can show progress over time and be compared to
an intended goal line. Visuals help you quickly determine if you are meeting, exceeding, or
falling behind on goals.  
One way to describe students' progress is by using 3 categories: suffcient growth, uncertain
growth, and insuffcient growth. Let's take a look at what these categories mean.
Sufffcient Growth –
The graph in the picture demonstrates suffcient growth, meaning that the student is exceeding
their goal!
The student line (blue) is steeper and greater than the goal line (green). Steeper lines show that
desired growth has been achieved while participating in that intervention. 
In general, a student line should be a few (2 or 3) data points above the goal line to show that the
student has demonstrated consistently improved performance. This may be a good time to
reduce the intensity and frequency of support.
Uncertain Growth –
The graph in the picture demonstrates uncertain growth. 
The student line (blue) is wavering around the goal line (green). This may mean that you need to
take a closer look at the intervention/practices. 
At this point, check the frequency, ﬁdelity (the extent to which it is delivered as intended), and
intensity of the intervention. If the intervention is to meet with the school counselor weekly, it
could be that the student is missing these meetings—suggesting that the student is not actually
receiving treatment. 
You could also compare this student’s data to another student who is also receiving the same
treatment. If the other student is showing growth, the intervention may not work for this particular student.
Insufffcient Growth –
The graph in the picture demonstrates insuffcient growth. In this case, the student is still
improving; however, they are not growing at the rate that is hoped for. 
The student line (blue) is below the goal line (green). This may mean that the
intervention/practice is not working, and another intervention should be tried for the student. 
The next step is similar to uncertain growth. First, check if the intervention is being delivered
with ﬁdelity. If the intervention is delivered as intended, then it is now time to connect with the
MTSS team to review the student's data and develop a new support plan. 
For the new support plan, we recommend the following adjustments: 
- a focus on a different and/or more foundational skill 
- a change in the intervention strategy or program 
- a change in the time of the intervention sessions 
- a change in the interventionist 
- an increase in the intervention frequency 
Note: While these graphs indicate increases in desired outcomes, some graphs indicate
decreasing outcomes. For example, a student's goal may be to reduce offfce discipline
referrals each month. In these cases, the student line is still compared to the goal line;
however, it is hoped that the student is at or below the goal line instead of at or above the
goal line. Setting goals before progress monitoring lets you know exactly what to look for
in these graphs.

What do we do with this information?
If students are achieving suffcient growth, then that's great! Interventions can continue as
needed, and then decisions can be made to reduce interventions as ﬁt. However, if the team
reviews data and the student is not improving, there are several options. The team might decide
to discontinue or scale back the current intervention. Reviewing the data, the team might learn
that there are other prerequisite skills the student needs to work on rather than the original
target. For instance, if a student is not yet ready to participate in whole group instruction, the
team may decide to help the student build skills to remain in or near the group during
instruction. Alternatively, the team may ﬁnd another intervention that could be more effective
and decide to implement that instead.   
For more tips on progress monitoring for clinicians, we
hear from Dr. Ashley Greenwald, Director of the Nevada
PBIS Technical Assistance Center, in the video below.
As mentioned in the video, some goals may be challenging to monitor progress for, especially if
you are working on social or emotional goals that may not have as much observable data. For
students in small groups or individual interventions, clinicians' notes are a valuable source of
data. Don't forget to gather data on students' thoughts and feelings that are not as easily
observable!

Measuring Fidelity
When we hear progress monitoring, we tend to think of measuring students' progress. After all,
we are gathering data on students every day! We should also gather information to determine if
we are implementing programs, practices, and services as they were developed. You may have
heard of this referred to as intervention ﬁdelity. Before we can have conﬁdence in the
effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of a program or practice, we need to be conﬁdent about
ﬁdelity to that practice.
How do we measure intervention ffdelity?
This depends. If your intervention should include 3 sessions per week, and there are only one or
two sessions a week, there is clearly a problem with ﬁdelity. Keeping logs of sessions and
student attendance is one simple way to quickly check this type of ﬁdelity. If you're using a
manualized intervention, you would want to review your sessions to make sure you are
following all of the included steps. Some programs come with checklists. If not, making a
checklist for yourself can be helpful. Whatever interventions your school or district chooses,
there should be regular ﬁdelity checks. Your team can problem solve barriers to ﬁdelity early on
for the best results.
Brief measures can also be collected from families, teachers, and students. For Tier 3 services,
the Patient-Centered Outcomes Management System (PCOMS) is a brief measure that gathers
feedback from therapy clients and can identify issues or barriers to treatment success. You can
also use more informal measures, like quick electronic forms, to get a sense of how students,
families, and teachers think an intervention is going.
The Center on Multi-tiered System of Supports at the
American Institutes for Research (AIR) has additional

Progress Monitoring
At the student level, progress monitoring is used to assess students'
performance, to quantify a student's rate of improvement or responsiveness to
instruction or intervention, and to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction
using valid and reliable measures. In addition, across all levels of the system
sites monitor progress to provide feedback for improvement.



Data-informed Decision Making and MTSS

Connecting Principles to Systems
A graphic illustrating the components of data-informed decision making (adapted
from the Center on Multi-Tiered System of Supports)
The graphic above shows the three main components of data-informed decision making:
progress monitoring, screening, and a multi-level prevention system (like MTSS). As a practice,
data-informed decision making is a core element of MTSS and occurs across all three tiers. It is
central to identifying needs, connecting to appropriate services and instruction, and
monitoring progress toward goals.
MTSS is most effective when many types of data are examined collectively. This means looking
at academic, social, emotional, behavioral, administrative, and other survey data together to see
a more complete picture of your students, staff, school, and district. In this way, MTSS supports
all students as a whole. Let's review what this might look like at each tier of the system.

Tier 1
Universal (Tier 1) data is reviewed to support an entire school, classroom, or grade level. Class-
wide data, for example, helps teachers determine what types of instruction to offer all students.
Within the classroom, teachers may also struggle with students’ behavior, and universal
behavior supports such as schedules and routines may signiﬁcantly reduce the frequency and
intensity of challenging behaviors. Staff who review Tier 1 data with teachers can support them
with resources and strategies (e.g., coaching, professional development) to meet student
needs. 
In general, teams review Tier 1 data monthly to monitor the impact and effectiveness of Tier 1
evidence-based practices. Teams make adjustments if challenges are still present for most
students. If a Tier 1 practice or program is changed, looking at data before and after that change
is a great way to evaluate the success of that program or strategy. Always keep in mind ﬁdelity—
the extent to which a practice or program is being delivered as intended. If there are barriers to
program or practice ﬁdelity, these barriers must be addressed or another program or practice
selected.
If many or most students seem to need supplemental (Tier 2) support, it is likely introducing or
bolstering a high quality universal (Tier 1) program or practice will be enough to reduce
challenges and meet needs. Examining universal data early in the year and two additional times
during the school year and implementing high quality Tier 1 programming can prevent many
challenges for teachers, staff, and students.

Tier 2
Even when the evidence-based practices and programs are delivered with ﬁdelity and a high
degree of quality, there will still be some students who need additional support—this is when
supplemental (Tier 2) supports should be used. 
With Tier 1 practices in place, school teams should draft decision rules for identifying students
for supplemental (Tier 2) support. Data used as part of the identiﬁcation process may include: 
- Offce discipline referrals
- Suspensions
- Classroom minor behavior challenges
- Instructional time lost
- Academic performance
- Attendance and/or tardiness
The nature of the Tier 2 support should be matched with students' needs.
When developing intervention plans at Tier 2, it is essential to work with students’ strengths to
successfully meet needs.
For example, you may see from data that John is disturbing others and having diffculty
completing tasks. John also scored high on positive relationships. John may be able to
adapt/change his behaviors in the classroom with an approach where he is able to learn from
his peers, such as group work. 
Some districts use programs that aggregate student data and ffag students at risk for
academic or behavioral problems. These programs can give a helpful overview of the
student population of a school or district; at times, further examination of data or
information gathering may be required to understand the scope or depth of a student’s
issues. While these programs can be a useful resource, they do not take the place of
regular data reviews by the MTSS team.

Tier 3
With Tier 1 and Tier 2 support in place, a few students will continue to need more intensive
intervention—this is the Tier 3 intervention or intensive intervention. 
To identify if a student needs Tier 3 support, plan to look at multiple data points for individuals
(multiple points in time and multiple types of data). Tier 3 often requires an intensive data
review before making any decisions about intended interventions or evidence-based practices.
This intensive review is generally conducted by an interventionist or data team (NCII, 2013). 
Students who are referred or identiﬁed for Tier 3 support usually have already been provided
Tier 2 support. As with Tier 1 supports, consider if Tier 2 supports were delivered with ﬁdelity
and were a good match for the student's needs.
For Tier 3 support services, family input and involvement should be sought. Tier 3 services
should be multimodal, meaning that a therapist or interventionist would be providing
intervention, and classroom teachers (or others) would be providing additional supports across
the student's many environments. 
Make sure to let your students know that they can keep in contact with you even when
they move back to Tier 1! This may look like dropping by in the morning to say hello on
the way to class, or occasionally having lunch together at school.

Key Ways to Leverage Data Across All Tiers
Now that you have learned about data-informed
decision making at each tier, let's summarize some best
practices across all tiers! Click through the graphic
below.
Focus on different sources of data:
Validate your concerns with multiple sources of data. For example, examine attendance, discipline, and
depression screening data together.
Focus on the student as a whole:
Understand students' behavioral, social-emotional, and academic struggles and strengths in providing
the right support.
Let the data speak for itself:
Don't frame decisions based on assumptions and predictions. Comprehensively examine the data to guide
decisions. Look for or collect more data if you do not think you have enough information.
Understand the data:
Have a data code book that explains what each assessment measures. This way, others who are handling
the data are better equipped to make impactful decisions.
Know your students:
Knowing your students and understanding their experiences will help you better understand the reasons
behind a challenging behavior.
Analyze needs and strengths:
Observe the needs AND celebrate the successes and strengths!
Examine the underlying problem:
Do not rely only on students' symptoms for information. Work with your team to better understand what
is causing the problem. Generate multiple explanations and use data to guide you to the most likely cause.
Analyze data equitably:
Examine data by age, race, ethnicity, and other factors to make sure you fully address the needs of ALL
students.

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- Data is an extremely valuable tool in making decisions. Data is advantageous
because it can help make decisions less biased or inequitable, increase effciency of
classroom instruction/interventions, and identify both strengths and needs of
students. 
- Too much data can be exhausting and time consuming. Select and organize your
data sources to help make it more manageable. Some common data sources include
attendance and behavior records, academic assessments, grades, and test scores.
- Data is used to identify speciﬁc needs, connect to appropriate supports, and
monitor progress. The three main phases of progress monitoring include goal-
setting, visualizing progress, and measuring ﬁdelity. 
- Data-informed decisions are made across all three tiers of support to connect
students to support and make decisions about best practices.

screening

Universal Screening
Enhancing Awareness
You’ve heard universal screening mentioned through the previous lessons, but you may not be
as familiar with it as you want to be. Don’t worry! We’re going to go over it in much more detail
here. 
Universal screening is a systematic process of administering assessments to all students in a
school to identify students who may be at risk for certain negative outcomes or are in need of
additional support. This process is important because it identiﬁes concerns proactively and
helps students connect early with interventions and supports. For example, you may be familiar
with:
- Periodic Vision and Hearing Screening: All students are screened for vision and
hearing problems before entering school because of the impact of hearing and
vision problems on educational and social/emotional outcomes. When students are
identiﬁed through this process, they can be connected to vision and hearing
specialists for further testing and support. 
- Literacy Screening: Act 213 (provides direction on the implementation of South
Carolina MTSS and the use of approved screeners) requires that districts must
screen all kindergarten and 1st-grade students to determine their risk level in
reading. Like vision and hearing screening, the results of this can also help connect
students in need of additional support to literacy specialists and interventions.
- Kindergarten Readiness: South Carolina Code § 59-155-150 requires that students
entering publicly funded prekindergarten and kindergarten must be administered a
readiness assessment by the 45th day of the school year. 
- Other Academic Screening: There are other academic screening assessments, such
as MAP and CogAT. These assessments are used to identify learning needs and
customize instruction, such as identifying students for gifted and talented
programs.
Let's take a moment to watch this short video and
review the basics of universal screening in schools.
The Basics of Universal Screening
The Basics of Universal Screening
Let's recap what was in this video: 
- Screening is preventative and proactive: identifying student needs early can help students
connect to support before problems become larger 
- Screening can be applied to reading, math, and social-emotional-behavioral skills
In this lesson, we will focus on social-emotional-behavioral (SEB) screening. 
 “Awareness is the greatest agent for change.”   
- Eckhart Tolle, teacher and self-help author


What is Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Health Screening? 
The three critical and interrelated components of mental health are social - how we relate to
others, emotional - how we feel, and behavioral - how we act (Chafouleas, 2020). Universal
screening applied to social, emotional, and behavioral functioning can help identify students
with an elevated risk of having or developing a mental health disorder (e.g., Dvorsky et al., 2014).
Importantly, screening does not diagnose mental health disorders. Its purpose is to identify
students who may be at risk in order to provide further testing or connect to supports as
needed.  
To learn more about social-emotional-behavioral
screening, review the video featuring Kathleen Lane
below. 
Let's do a quick review of some of the main points of the above video:
Screening can indicate internalizing and externalizing concerns – internalizing concerns
can be more challenging to identify because of the lack of external behaviors that teachers
or other adults notice, so screening is important for catching these students
Screening happens in the fall (after school has started), winter, and spring
Screening can help identify which tier of support is needed for students: it could indicate
problems that may need to be addressed at the Tier 1 level, or indicate students or groups in
need of Tier 2 or Tier 3 intervention services 
Screening can help identify student strengths as well as needs

Screening Measures
Let’s review a little more about what SEB screening tools measure. As mentioned in the video,
SEB screening can indicate that some students may be at higher risk for developing mental
health disorders. These might be internalizing or externalizing. Let’s look at the difference
between the two.
IMAGE HERE
Again, screening tools do not diagnose disorders. However, they can ﬂag students for further
testing and connect to support before concerns may become a disorder.  
Beyond this, we also know that good mental health is not simply the absence of risk, but the
possession of skills necessary to cope with transitions, changes, and everyday challenges.
Because mental health is not just the absence of risk, screening tools might also address
general social-emotional-behavioral competencies. Some of the skills they might test for
include: 
Self-Awareness:
Self-awareness involves understanding one's own emotions, personal goals, and values.
This includes accurately assessing one's strengths and limitations, having a positive
mindset, and possessing a well-grounded sense of self-effcacy and optimism. High levels
of self-awareness require the ability to recognize how thoughts, feelings, and actions are
interconnected.
Self-Management:
Self-management requires skills and attitudes that facilitate the ability to regulate one's own
emotions and behaviors. This includes the ability to delay gratiﬁcation, manage stress,
control impulses, and persevere through challenges in order to achieve personal and
educational goals.
Social Awareness:
Social awareness involves the ability to understand, empathize, and feel compassion for
those with different backgrounds or cultures. It also involves understanding social norms
for behavior and recognizing family, school, and community resources and supports.
Relationship Skills:
Relationship skills help students establish and maintain healthy and rewarding
relationships, and to act in accordance with social norms. These skills involve
communicating clearly, listening actively, cooperating, resisting inappropriate social
pressure, negotiating conﬂict constructively, and seeking help when it is needed.
Responsible Decision Making:
Responsible decision making involves learning how to make constructive choices about
personal behavior and social interactions across diverse settings. It requires the ability to
consider ethical standards, safety concerns, accurate behavioral norms for risky behaviors,
the health and wellbeing of self and others, and to make realistic evaluations of various
consequences of actions. 
Different screening tools will measure social, emotional, and behavioral health differently and
may focus on different aspects of the areas mentioned above. We will review some example
screening tools later in this lesson, so stay tuned for more information!

Why is Universal SEB Screening Important?
The U.S. Department of Education recognizes that universal screening is a critical ﬁrst step in
identifying students who are at risk for experiencing diffculties that threaten to impede the
learning process and impact their mental health and wellbeing. One of the key action steps
recommended is to use screening tools. In this section, let's examine why these screening tools
are so important.
Screening is extremely useful in the quest for overall student wellbeing. Screening can promote
social and emotional development for all students in classrooms by identifying those students
struggling with mental health challenges that impact their full access to and participation in
learning. SEB screenings in schools allow staff to:
- Proactively identify a signiﬁcant percentage of students that may be at risk for
social- emotional problems or mental illnesses
- Identify more details about those currently experiencing a range of mental health
concerns
- Identify those experiencing diffculties that have, thus far, gone undetected
- Decide when students may need additional services beyond Tier 1 (universal) into 
 Tier 2 (targeted) support and Tier 3 (intensive) support
- Determine if any school-wide trends are present that may need to be addressed at
the Tier 1 level
This early identiﬁcation of mental health concerns is extremely important. As you learned in
"All Hands on Deck," mental health challenges are a concern for many students: 1 in 6 children
is diagnosed with a mental health condition. In addition, approximately 50% of lifetime mental
health conditions begin by age 14 and 75% begin by age 24. At the same time, the average delay
between when symptoms ﬁrst appear and intervention is approximately 11 years (National
Alliance on Mental Illness, 2023).
When left untreated or undertreated, coping with the pain of mental illness can also contribute
to self-harm and thoughts of suicide, which is one of the leading causes of death for young
people ages 10-24 (Centers for Disease Control, 2020).  
Universal social, emotional, and behavioral health screenings in school allow for early
identiﬁcation, prevention, and connecting students with needed mental health services and
interventions. Here are some reasons why universal screening assessments are especially
helpful for identifying students who are at risk for developing mental illnesses: 
1. Youth do not generally seek help on their own. Young people are reluctant to seek
help for mental health problems (Chan & Quinn, 2012; Yap, et al., 2013) due to
stigma and/or inability to recognize there is a problem.
2. Adults are not always able to correctly identify youth who experience mental health
issues by observation only. It is often diffcult to correctly recognize mental health
issues in young people. Adults may not know what signs to look for and may not
understand how to encourage young people to seek help.
3. Reliable screening instruments are widely available. Schools and staff have access
to a full range of valid evidence-based screening instruments.
4. Help is available. Schools have access to programs offered by staff within the
schools along with external community partners who come to schools to offer
supports.

“Students come to school each day with more than their lunch and
backpack. They bring life factors that shape their learning and
development. These inffuences range from family issues, health
concerns, and culture...to behavior, learning proffles, and
abilities...all have the potential to impact the mental health of
students.” 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)

Implementing Universal SEB Screening
Applying the Strategy
Now that we have more information on what universal SEB screening is, let's examine what this
looks like when being implemented in the school setting. 
Based on a review of approximately 35 publications on school‐based mental health screening,
mental health screening within an MTSS framework is occurring nationally in all grade levels
(National Center for School Mental Health, 2015). In fact, a recent internal survey conducted by
the School Superintendents Association indicated that “students’ behavioral health needs”
were the top concern of superintendents across the country (Jackson, 2018).
However, even though universal behavioral health screening in schools has been proven
effective, adoption of screening practices has been limited. Many schools continue to rely on
offce discipline referrals as a primary source for the identiﬁcation of students needing support.
Data from multiple studies indicate that, at most, only 20% of schools currently engage in
mental health screening (Herman et al.,2020). Review the list below for some common barriers
to implementing SEB screening. 
Awareness –
One barrier to implementing SEB screening may be that not all educators are aware that such
screening practices exist or may not know how to use them (Bruhn et al., 2014). 
Limited support –
Schools may be hesitant to implement SEB screenings because of a concern that it will identify a
larger number of youth in need of intervention than can readily and feasibly be served by a school
(Dever et al., 2012).
Time –
Many schools may have a substantial number of required screenings already in place, and adding
SEB screening may be a concern for time and resources. 
Community responses –
Educators may be concerned about negative reactions or hesitation from students' parents and
caregivers (Bruhn et al., 2014).
Limited training –
Educators may not have received enough guidance and training around how to carry out
screenings (Moffa et al., 2018). 

Planning for Implementation
Having a plan for screening can help address some of these concerns and break down some of
these barriers. Careful planning and preparation are key. To be initiated successfully, issues
related to the following factors must be addressed:
- Obtaining district, staff, student, and family cooperation: involved stakeholders should
consider the screener to be acceptable and useful   
- It must be practical to universally administer the screener within the desired context. This
includes clear instructions and examples to explain any diffcult concepts. 
- Allocating resources (ﬁscal and staffng) to support the screening process
	Training and professional development regarding screening (administration, data
	analyses, decision making, intervention selection, and rules related to decisions)  
	Deﬁning roles and responsibilities of all staff involved in the screening process 
- Addressing ethical, legal, and liability considerations (e.g., parental consent and student
assent; communication; conﬁdentiality) 
- Developing and expanding data systems 
- Identifying and coordinating resources necessary to support students in need of additional
intervention 
- Time
	Consider the amount of time needed to collect, store, enter, manage and analyze
	screener data, in addition to time for administration
	An additional consideration is time that personnel will need to train staff in the
	administration and completion of the screening process


Selecting Screening Tools
Once an initial plan for screening is in place, schools and districts can begin selecting the
screeners that are most appropriate for their needs. A wide variety of evidence-based screening
instruments have been developed and are available for use in schools, with each tool having its
own strengths and weaknesses. In this section of the lesson, we will discuss what to look for in
a screening tool. Overall, primary considerations should be whether the evidence-based
instrument provides the appropriate information that the school desires and whether the
instrument is a "good ﬁt” for the school. 
For more information determining if screening tools are
a good fft for your school, review the video below from
the Comprehensive Integrated Three-Tiered Model of
Prevention, featuring Dr. Kathleen Lane. 
Concluding Thoughts on Screening
Concluding Thoughts on Screening
To summarize Dr. Lane's main points: 
- The question is not if you screen, but which tool to use 
- There are four recommendations for implementing screening effectively:  
	Build expertise – know how to use screening tools and provide training for anyone
	administering them
	Develop structures for improving practices 
	Conduct screening responsibly - apply research, use Technical Assistance centers,
	and seek input and feedback
	Consider legal implications – know state laws 
- Some questions to consider when you are selecting screeners are: age/grade level, who
completes the screener, types of concerns assessed, cost, time, is intervention included?
- Have a plan – know what you are going to do with screening data, and be careful not to
overwhelm the system
- The best screening tool is the one that best meets the needs of your individual school
Let's examine two of these points in more detail: 1) using screening responsibly, and 2)
matching screeners to needs.

Using Screeners Responsibly
As mentioned in the video, it is important to use tools that are backed by research and have
evidence for their effectiveness. Validity, reliability, classiﬁcation accuracy, statistical bias, and
sample representativeness are all important indicators of the effectiveness of a screening tool.
Review the ﬂashcards below to learn more about what these terms mean.
Validity: Validity refers to how well the measure indicates what it intends
to. For example: does the screener accurately identify students who
have behavioral challenges?
Reliability: Reliability is an indicator of the consistency of the measure. For
example, does the screener show the same results when repeated?
Classiffcation accuracy : Classiffcation accuracy refers to whether or not the measure is
accurate in its results, or if there are false negatives (identifying
students as not being at risk even though they are) or false positives
(identifying students as at-risk when they aren't).
Statistical bias: Statistical bias refers to how well the measure works for
different student groups. It is important for screening tools to work equally well across all
student groups, so if there is any disproportionality indicated by the screener, other
assessment tools may be needed or modifications may be needed. 
Sample representativeness: Sample representativeness refers to whether or not the measure is
used for the population that it was designed for. For example, a screening tool might be based on a
national sample or based on a speciffc state. 
The National Center on Intensive Intervention at the
American Institute of Research provides ffve one-page
documents with a brief overview of each of these areas.

Matching Screeners to Needs
Once tools that are evidence-based have been identiﬁed, the next step is to determine which of
these tools will work best for your speciﬁc school or district. One question to ask to help
determine the right ﬁt for a screening tool is what purpose the screening is intended to have in
the school. While the general purpose of universal screening is well-deﬁned, school teams need
to come to a consensus about the purpose of screening in their school building. Having a clear
purpose can help teams reach their desired outcomes. 
Review the image below for a list of questions to ask about the purpose of a screening tool. Click
to enlarge. 
IMAGE HERE
Graphic of four questions to determine the purpose of a screening tool
Once the purpose of screening has been identiﬁed, it is also important to consider the usability
and feasibility of the measure as well as its contextual appropriateness. Review the cards below
for more information about these aspects of screening tools.

Usability and Feasibility:
Usability and feasibility are important considerations in determining ﬁt. Some questions to
ask include: 
	-Can the data be collected, analyzed, interpreted, and used within the constraints of the
	educational environment?
	-Is the data accessible and understandable?

Contextual Appropriateness:
Different screening tools are designed for different groups of students. When selecting a
screening tool, it is important to consider the context that it was designed for. Questions to
ask about contextual appropriateness include:
	- What ages/grades is the measure intended for?
	- What language is the measure available in? Is it accessible for English Language
	Learners? 
	- Does the screening tool function similarly across different student subgroups?
	- What are the similarities and differences between your student population and the
	population used as the "norm" group (the group used to research and develop the
	screener you will be using)?
Answering these questions can ensure that the screening tool is the right ﬁt for your student
population.


The list below describes some common traits of strong
screening tools (O'Malley, 2020).
- Low cost
- Low time demand
- Psychometrically sound
- Assesses key domains and links to an MTSS Framework
- Easy to access, collect, and interpret data
While these traits are generally beneﬁcial in a screening tool, as mentioned earlier, the most
important aspect of selecting screening tools is that they are a good ﬁt for your speciﬁc
community. For more information about speciﬁc screening tools that are available and meet
these criteria, keep going with this lesson!




Survey of Screening Tools
What is Available?
Now that we know more about what screening tools are, why they are useful, and some
considerations for implementing them, let's review some examples of screening tools that are
currently available. There are many more screening tools than we will review here, so there are
many options!

The Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD)
The SSBD is an evidence-based screening system for identifying students who are at risk for
internalizing and externalizing problems. These two forms of behavioral problems can disrupt
social adjustment and impair academic success. SSBD provides the means to quickly identify
these students and enables school staff to implement early interventions and supports. Click the
play button to watch.


The Student Risk Screening Scale - Internalizing and
Externalizing (SRSS)
The SRSS-IE (Drummond, 1994; Lane & Menzies, 2009) is a universal screening tool used three
times per year to identify students who may be at risk for challenging, antisocial behavior. The
SRSS-IE is conducted to better inform instruction. It is not used to exclude students from the
instructional environment. Rather, it is used to select appropriate support for students. The
SRSS is not used independently to determine special education eligibility or make other high-
stakes decisions. The SRSS-IE, like all universal screening tools, is not used to label students.
The SRSS-IE is not intended as an assessment of traits or personality. It should be used as one
of multiple data sources to indicate student risk. 

Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System
(BIMAS-2)
The Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System (BIMAS-2™) is a measure of
behavioral functioning and social, emotional skills in children and adolescents ages pre-k to 18
years. 
The BIMAS 2- can:
- Identify children who are at risk with an early warning system
- Monitor the effectiveness of system-wide interventions like Positive Behavior Supports,
(PBS), or Social Emotional Learning, (SEL)
- Monitor small group or individual intervention plans
- Analyze common behavioral concerns and adaptive behavior
For more information, review the link below.

The Strengths and Difffculties Questionnaire
The Strengths and Diffculties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief, 25-item measure of behavioral
and emotional diffculties that can be used to assess mental health problems in children and
young people aged 4–17 years. The SDQ can capture the perspective of the child/young person
(self-report) or the observations of parents and teachers.
The SDQ can be used as a screening tool or to measure treatment outcomes, and it has been
extensively implemented across countries for research and clinical purposes. It is available in
over 40 different languages and can be used without charge for non-commercial purposes.
Review the link below for more information and downloads of multiple versions of the
assessment. 
A) 25 items on psychological attributes. All versions of the SDQ ask about 25
attributes, some positive and others negative.

The Social, Academic, & Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS) 
The Social, Academic, & Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS) is a brief tool supported by
research for use in universal screening for behavioral and emotional risk. The measure falls
within a broad class of highly effcient tools and is suitable for teacher use in evaluating and
rating all students on common behavioral criteria (Severson, et al., 2007). The SAEBRS is
designed for use in the K-12 setting. It is grounded within a conceptual model, which states that
a student’s success in school is not only related to his or her academic achievement, but also to
success within multiple behavioral domains.
Follow the link below for more information. 

FastBridge SAEBRS
Social Behavior Domain (6 items) Students' ability to understand social norms,
empathize, and understand the perspectives of others. Academic Behavior
Domain (6 items) Skills necessary for students to be prepared for, participate
in, and beneﬁt from academic instruction. Emotional Behavior Domain (7
items) Students' ability to regulate internal states, adapt to change, and
respond to stressful/challenging events.

WCSD's Social and Emotional Competency Assessment 
The WCSD Social and Emotional Competency Assessment (SECA) is a set of instruments
developed through a collaboration between Washoe County School District in Nevada, the
Collaborative for Academic and Social Emotional Learning (CASEL), and the University of Illinois
at Chicago through an Institute of Education Sciences Research-Practitioner Partnership grant.
The project resulted in the development of two instruments and a bank of items aligned to the
CASEL 5 clusters and WCSD SEL standards. 
Long-Form Assessment: 40-item instrument measuring eight domains of social and emotional
competence: 
- self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses 
- self-awareness of emotions 
- self-management of emotions 
- self-management of goals
- self-management of schoolwork
- relationship skills 
- social awareness
- responsible decision-making
Short-Form Assessment: 17-item, short-form assessment of global social and emotional
competence.  
Item Bank: 138 items assessing eight domains. Useful for training and item replacement.

All three instruments are free and open-source. You and your organization can use and adapt the
instruments any way you would like. You do not need to request permission to use these
instruments, but it is appreciated if you would cite the measure to track how organizations use
the instruments, expand the knowledge base, and connect users together. The measure can be
cited as “items from or adapted from the WCSD Social and Emotional Competency Assessment
(Davidson et al., 2017).” Review the link below for more information.

Let's review the lesson.
- Universal screening is applied in the school setting for many different outcomes,
including social-emotional-behavioral health.
- The purpose of universal SEB screening is to identify students who may be at-risk
for SEB concerns, such as behavior disorders or mental illnesses.
- Universal SEB screening is proactive and preventative, identifying needs that may
have otherwise gone undetected.
- There are many considerations for implementing screening processes in your
school, including the evidence base for the screening tool, affordability, and
feasibility of implementation.

Strengthening School-Family-Community
Partnerships
Outcomes:
1. Establish the importance of family and community connections
2. Evaluate framework approaches to school-family-community involvement 
3. Identify strategies for implementing school-family-community involvement at each
tier of MTSS
4. Review tools and resources for assessing school-family-community partnerships

What are School-Family-Community Partnerships?
Fostering a Collaborative and Supportive Environment
Schools, families, and communities all play a central role in supporting children's success and
wellbeing. In this lesson, we will learn how to make the most of these resources by working
together as a team! To start, let’s review what school-family-community partnerships are.
Deffnition: School-family-community partnerships involve a collaborative relationship
between families, educators, providers, and community partners to support student
learning and improve the health of every learner.  
From this foundational deﬁnition, school-family-community partnerships can grow in their
own unique ways, especially as different schools, families, and communities engage in
partnerships to meet their unique needs. A great example of how school-family-community
partnerships can differ from one another is who is included within those partnerships.   

Families can include: 
- any caretakers or people with signiﬁcant relationships with
children 
- biological or adoptive parents, step-parents, or guardians who
are primary caretakers
- family members such as siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, or
others
- any other community members with signiﬁcant relationships to
students, such as close family friends

Sometimes, school-family involvement is also referred to as parent-
school involvement. The term “families” is preferred here because it
is more inclusive of various family structures, such as adoptive
parents, grandparents, step-parents, and many other family
members who step in to support children in the community.

Community partners may include: 
- health organizations (mental health centers, pediatrician’s offces, etc.)
- local businesses
- non-proﬁt organizations (local foodbanks, homeless shelters, libraries, etc.)
- any other community organizations that support students
The previous lesson on team-based leadership discussed how creating the roadmap with teams
at the district and school level is key; the same applies here! Families and communities are
crucial partners as the journey to MTSS is embarked upon. Now that we’ve established a base
deﬁnition of what school-family-community partnerships are, let’s look at the how behind
them!


Involving or Engaging?
Imagine trying to build a roadmap with a partner that you do not speak to. Saying it'd be a
challenge puts it lightly! It is important for communication to ﬂow back and forth from families
to schools and from schools to families. Trust is built over time and develops as families become
comfortable with the school supporting their child and schools feel the same way towards
families.  
In other words, families and schools build partnerships by being engaged with one another.
However, engagement may be substituted for involvement. Let’s look at the differences between
involvement and engagement now! 
IMAGE HERE
Differences between involvement and engagement, adapted from the Michigan
Department of Education (2020) 
The main difference here is that engagement helps us form an equal, two-way partnership,
rather than a hierarchical or one-way relationship. One way to think about this is the distinction
between doing things for or to families compared to doing things with them as equal partners. 
The transition from involvement to engagement can sound vague and unattainable; let’s look at
some activities that families and communities can participate in as a way to engage with the
school. Epstein et. al (1995) provide six areas of opportunity for partnership: 
1. Parenting: help all families establish home environments to support children as
students 
2. Communicating: design effective forms of school-to-home and home-to-school
communications about school programs and children's progress 
3. Volunteering: recruit and organize parent help and support 
4. Learning at Home: provide information and ideas to families about how to help
students at home with homework and other curriculum-related activities,
decisions, and planning 
5. Decision Making: include parents in school decisions, developing parent leaders
and representatives (representation on MTSS teams) 
6. Collaborating with the Community: identify and integrate resources and services
from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student
learning and development

Click through the ffashcards to see examples of
meaningful engagement! 
Parenting: Family support groups, Workshops on parenting skills, Parent education
Communicating: Parent-teacher conferences, Newsletters, report cards, or student work sent home, Calls, text messages, or emails
about school events, Translators provided as needed
Volunteering: Family support at school events,  Partnering with local charities or service organizations
Learning at Home: Information about curriculum, homework, or class activities, Summer learning, such as
summer reading, Calendars with suggested activities
Decision Making: Parent-teacher organization or association (PTO/PTA), District Community Leadership Team (DCLT)
Councils and committees with family inclusion, Seeking out and applying feedback
Collaborating: Information and referrals for community programs (arts, sports, summer activities, etc.)
Service organization partnerships, Alumni programs

Before we move onto focus on the "why" we ought to partner with families speciﬁcally, reﬂect
on your own setting and think of which examples of meaningful engagement would best ﬁt
your community!

If everyone is moving forward together, then success
takes care of itself.
Henry Ford, American Industrialist



Why Partner with Families? 
Unlocking the Power of Collaboration: The Beneﬁts of School-Family Partnerships
Now that we have a better idea of what family partnerships are, let's take a look at some of the
reasons why family engagement is mutually beneﬁcial. First, review the following video which
highlights a successful parent-school relationship. In this video, you’ll meet Mardee King who
has been the student services coordinator for Medical Lake School District in Washington for
over 30 years. You’ll also meet Nikki, a parent and family partner in the Medical Lake School
District as well as a mother, grandmother, and advocate for one of her children who is
diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. 
Following the video, we will walk through more reasons why school-family-community
partnerships are key throughout your MTSS. 
As you saw in the video, family involvement can play a powerful role in improving our schools.
Let’s take a closer look at some of the ways family engagement can make our schools stronger.

Successful family engagement can: 
Increase Equitable Outcomes –
Schools are part of diverse communities with many types of people of different races, cultures,
and identities. Engaging all community members can help promote an understanding and respect
for diversity in the school environment. Including family voice and choice, and ensuring that all
cultures are represented, helps to create a better connection between the community children
live in and the schools they attend. Inclusion of all voices also creates an environment of mutual
respect where all perspectives are valued. 
Increase Effectiveness of Interventions –
Engaging with families is also helpful for students who receive interventions. Engagement helps
because many interventions involve parent/caregiver support, such as Parent-Child Interaction
Therapy (PCIT). Even when interventions do not require direct family support, having parents
and families on the same page as school-based providers can help support treatment and enable
students to reach goals faster. 
Improve Academic Outcomes –
While students spend a signiﬁcant amount of time in school, a great amount of learning happens
at home as well. Families can be an extremely valuable asset in supporting student academics at
home. Families can: 
help students with homework  
encourage students to value education 
help students keep track of work 
provide their perspective on the material students learn 
create consistent expectations across the home and school environments  
This helps support student success and can improve academic outcomes, such as grades and test
scores. Academics can also be supported through strong family-teacher relationships—when
teachers have strong communication with families, everyone is on the same page. 
Reduce Behavioral Concerns –
Engaging families helps with behavior management by creating consistent expectations across
home and school environments. When students have rules that align at home and at school, they
are more easily able to meet the expectations of both.   
Increase Student Involvement in Extracurriculars –
Family engagement with the school can also encourage students to participate in extracurricular
activities: when families are in communication with schools, they are more aware of what
opportunities are available and more likely to encourage their children to participate.  
In addition to this wide evidence supporting the effectiveness of school-family-community
partnerships, legal requirements also support family and community engagement. Let’s look at
those now.


Legal Considerations
Two main pieces of legislation impact school and family partnerships: the Individuals with
Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Both laws aim
to support students, and both involve requirements for family engagement.

EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT (ESSA)
The Every Student Succeeds Act is a wide-reaching piece of legislation that impacts schools in
many ways. This piece of legislation was enacted in 2015 with the goal of increasing equal access
to quality education for all students in the United States. As part of this goal, guidelines are
provided for how to best engage families and parents.  
Highlights from the requirements outlined by this act include:  
- providing information for parents about the content covered in school, assessments, and
student progress 
- providing materials and training to help parents help their children 
- providing education to educators on how to best partner with families 
- coordinating with other programs, such as pre-school and parent resource centers 
- having communication that is understandable to families (translated in multiple languages
as needed) 
The act also includes suggested practices, such as:  
- using family feedback for school professional development activities 
- providing literacy training to parents and families 
- using funds for potential family expenses, such as transportation or childcare 
- encouraging families to connect with each other to support one another’s involvement 
- having ﬂexibility in meeting with families: having ﬂexible times and locations that may be
outside of the school 
- establishing district-wide family councils 
- partnering with community-based organizations and businesses 
There is much more to ESSA in addition to the practices listed above. Be sure to check with your
school administrators and leadership to see how your unique school meets the requirements of
this act.  


INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IN EDUCATION ACT (IDEA)
The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) is another wide-reaching piece of
legislation that supports students with a diagnosed disability, such as ADHD, autism, blindness,
deafness, and many others (for a full listing, see our “Cultural Humility” lesson). This act also
includes requirements for family involvement in the process of developing Individualized
Education Plans (IEPs) for students. This is especially relevant for family engagement at the Tier 3
level for students receiving interventions. Some highlights from this act include:  
- requiring families to be in attendance at IEP meetings at an agreed-on time and place 
- requiring schools to reach out to parents in advance 
- requiring translators for families who are deaf or speak other languages 
While these guidelines are speciﬁc to students with IEPs, they are also best practices for other
students in the school as well: some of these guidelines, like requiring translators, are similar to
what is mentioned in ESSA.  

Before we move onto more practical ways we can support school-family-community
partnerships, let’s apply what you’ve learned so far about the importance of family-school
partnerships speciﬁcally.



How to Support School-Family-Community Partnerships
Utilizing the Dual Capacity-Building Framework to Overcome
Challenges and Meet Goals
Trying to create a roadmap on your own, without help, to a place you haven't been before would
be overwhelming and potentially frightening. The good news is that you’re not searching for
how to do this on your own! Aside from working as a team within your school, you have tools to
guide you. One of the key tools that will aid you in practically building school-family-community
partnerships is the Dual Capacity-Building Framework. 

Dual Capacity-Building Framework
The Dual Capacity-Building Framework is an evidence-based set of recommendations for
promoting family engagement. The goal of this framework is to increase effective engagement
by addressing the many challenges or barriers to engagement that families and educators may
face through developing relationships and building the capacity of both groups. 
As shown in the graphic below, there are several components to the Dual Capacity-Building
Framework.  Click on the graphic to enlarge it. 
Graphic depiction of the Dual Capacity Building Framework
That image can look overwhelming; don’t worry. We’re about to break it down! To start, there
are four main components of the Dual Capacity-Building Framework: 
1 The Challenge
2 Essential Conditions
3 Policy and Program Goals
4 Capacity Outcomes
Let's unpack each of these items in more detail.

Component 1: The Challenge
The Challenge component of the Dual Capacity-Building Framework focuses on some of the
diffculties that both educators and families may face in trying to connect. The theory suggests
that while educators and parents both acknowledge the importance of family-school-
community partnerships, and both want to support children's academic success, various
obstacles can interfere with this goal.  
On the educator side, some of these challenges include:  
- Lack of training or guidelines for how to intentionally build positive relationships with families  
- Lack of time or other resources 
- Cultural differences
- Language barriers
- Lack of administrative support
- Negative past experiences, stereotypes, or deﬁcit mindsets about community members
On the family side, challenges may include: 
- Cultural differences and/or language barriers  
- Negative previous experiences, such as feeling unwelcomed, judged, or dismissed  
- Limited time and competing priorities
- Transportation or childcare needs  
As you may have noticed, educators and families may face similar challenges, such as: cultural
or linguistic differences, time pressure and other commitments, negative previous interactions,
or stereotypes about each other. Notably, educators and families don't lack the desire or effort to
connect, and they can overcome barriers by intentionally working together. The remainder of
the Dual Capacity-Building Framework addresses these challenges and empowers educators
and communities to work together.

Component 2: Essential Conditions
Essential conditions are in place to help us respond to the challenges of family engagement and
are needed to successfully develop partnerships. They can be divided into two categories:
process and organizational.  
Process conditions relate to steps or action items that are taken to support the building of
partnerships. Click through the ﬂashcards to learn more. 
1 of 5
Linked to learning: School-family-community partnerships should be linked to the learning that students do in the classroom. This shows families the expectations for their children and helps connect back to the goal of supporting children academically. An example of being linked to learning is providing families with handouts that provide extra information on what the student learned in class, as well as pointers and resources the family can use to help students with homework. 
2 of 5
Relational: To build effective partnerships, there needs to be strong relationships between families and schools built on trust and respect. This takes time and consistency. You can start with emails or phone calls introducing yourself as an educator or staff member, or work with your school administration to draft an introduction as a school! Key ways to build trust include responding to families or community partners within a set timeframe, asking open-ended questions, and seeking input on matters relevant to them.   
3 of 5
Developmental: Effective partnerships have the development of the community in mind; they seek to empower equal partnerships. This involves using a growth mindset: partnerships can always continue evolving and improving over time. For example, you may want to start with student volunteers or asking for school supply donations instead of jumping directly to a community partner sponsored event. This allows for relationship building and resource scaling!  
4 of 5
Collaborative: Partnerships should seek to truly involve all parties in collaborative and collective problem-solving. This is where two-way communication is needed to ensure that you are working with families. Examples of collaboration include having families on councils, collecting surveys regarding families’ experiences within the school, and seeking their input on schoolwide expectations. 
5 of 5
Interactive
These partnerships go beyond information dissemination or one-way communication and give partners the opportunity to actively engage. Some ways that partners can engage include: providing and receiving feedback, practicing skills, applying what has been learned, and participating in dialogues and discussions. 

Organizational conditions refer to conditions that must be met from an organizational
perspective, including the leadership teams for schools and districts. The organizational
conditions that must be met are reviewed in depth in the ﬂashcards below! 
1 of 3
Systemic: School-family-community partnerships are not random acts done at any time. They are systemic, ingrained in the school system, and considered an essential aspect of education. For example, the effort for starting or sustaining partnerships does not rest on a handful of educators who are interested but is instead explicitly supported by administration and planned for. 
2 of 3
Integrated: Policies and practices promoting school-family-partnerships are
considered within the full context of the school and are integrated into systems already in place. An
example of integration looks like including family members in school councils that are already running.
3 of 3
Sustained: Partnerships carried out consistently using the resources of the school and district over long periods of time rather than sporadically. Partnerships are planned for, part of the school culture, and able to last. This can look like bidirectional communication with families through weekly emails or phone calls instead of solely relying on end of term reviews or reaching out when there is an issue. 
Now that we’ve reviewed the conditions necessary to overcome the challenges, let’s look at the
next phase in the Dual Capacity-Building Framework: goals!


Component 3: Policy and Program Goals
Policy and program goals are unique to each school and district, but can be divided into four
categories: capabilities, connections, conﬁdence, and cognition. Use the tabs below to learn
more about each of those categories!

Capabilities: Human capital, skills, and knowledge –
These are goals focused on empowering families and educators to work together. For educators,
this could include building skills in cultural competence and humility, training in family
engagement, and any other resources needed to enable them to engage. For families, this can
include access to knowledge about student academics in the school, information about how to
navigate the school system, and other support or advocacy. 

Connections: Important relationships and networks, social capital –
Successful partnerships involve networks of relationships and social connections to enable
families to have the social capital to engage effectively.  Goals here can look like policies
regarding how often families are to be contacted and when, and distinct periods of seeking input
from families or community partners on how to better serve them and connect. 

Confidence: Individual level of self-efffcacy –
It is important for educators and communities to have conﬁdence and comfort in engaging with
each other. This means that educators have the resources needed to engage successfully, and
families are welcomed and shown that they are valued. 
Practically, this can look like setting aside rooms or times (e.g., every other Friday; Wednesdays
at 3:45 PM) for family engagement so that educators know that their administration supports
their family engagement efforts. Another example is ensuring that translators are available at the
school so that families who speak another primary language have the conﬁdence to engage with
the school instead of feeling intimidated by the language barrier. 

Cognition: Assumptions, beliefs, and worldview –
Assumptions, beliefs, and worldviews inﬂuence the attitudes and willingness of educators,
families, and the community to engage with each other. When educators, families, and
communities feel valued, believe in the importance of collaborating, and are committed, they are
able to build strong relationships. Providing continuing education opportunities for educators to
learn more about the value of family engagement or committing to restorative practices between
families and educators or staff who’ve experienced brokenness in their partnership are practical
examples of goals related to cognition. 
Once policy and program goals are in place, capacity outcomes can be reviewed!


Component 4: Capacity Outcomes
Capacity outcomes are the desired results of the policy and program goals. Ultimately, the main
outcome is an effective partnership that supports student and academic success. There are also
goals within this for both educators and families. For educators, some goals might be to:  
- View families and communities with understanding and strengths-based lens  
- Create a school/district culture that is open, accepting, and welcoming to families  
- Connect family/community involvement with student learning  
For families, some goals might be: 
- Support student learning and development
- Help monitor student time, behavior, and resources
- Encourage positive self-image and growth mindset for children
- Act as role models for students
- Collaborate with schools: act as leaders and/or advocates for children 
These are the four components of the Dual Capacity-Building Framework, but that’s not all
there is to it! The Dual Capacity-Building Framework also provides suggested strategies to
increase engagement.  
Let’s take a closer look at two of the suggested strategies: parent-teacher home visits and
academic parent-teacher teams.     


Parent-Teacher Home Visits
Parent-teacher home visits are one tool for increasing engagement recommended by the Dual
Capacity-Building Framework. This strategy involves educators visiting the homes of students
in their school to get to know the students' community and environment. These visits can
happen over the summer or at the beginning of the school year and can be an initial point of
contact for parents and teachers.
The purpose of this visit is not to report any problems, address any concerns, or suggest
anything. The visit is conducted to get to know the families and communities in the school
better and develop a trusting relationship. It is important to communicate to families that these
visits are purely about building relationships—some families may assume that this visit is due to
a concern that the school may have or feel like they are being investigated. Making it clear that
this is just to build a relationship is key for building trust and buy-in.  
From a parent’s perspective, hear how these visits can be helpful: 
“To make a long story short, that home
visit was the best visit of my life. Now, the
teacher and I are so connected. I really
appreciate these home visits; when I was
coming up we received home visits, but
they were for CPS or they were for
attendance issues. Home visits were for a
lot of negative issues and so there are a lot
of negative connotations around the idea
of home visits. I’m glad that is changing.”
- Ellen Little, Parent

Academic Parent Teacher Teams
Another tool is academic parent-teacher teams (APTT), a model of parent engagement
developed by Dr. Maria Paredes. These are based on parent-teacher conferences but involve a
group of parents meeting with a teacher to discuss the activities and curriculum going on in
class.  
The goal of these meetings is to provide families with a network so they can interact with each
other and increase their conﬁdence about engagement. This is achieved through three 75-
minute group meetings and one 30-minute individual meeting with parents each school year.  
This can also be a powerful tool for engagement, as evidenced by the following quote from an
educator describing their experience:
“Parents meet up to the expectations that teachers have for
parents, and then teachers meet up to the expectations that
parents have for teachers. I know what the parent wants for
their child, and they know what I want from their child and
from them. I do my part, they do their part, and then the
child does their part. We become the team.”
- Sheryl Garner, Teacher
These aren’t the only possibilities for increasing engagement. Look at the table below for a
variety of different ideas, organized by its level of impact (i.e., low, moderate, high) adapted from
the Michigan Department of Education (2020). 

TABLE HERE
Chart displaying low, moderate, and high-impact activities for engagement
Once plans for increasing the strength of school-family-community partnerships are in place,
you don’t have to sit around and wonder or guess how effective those plans are! There are ways
to assess the effectiveness of the partnerships more objectively. You’ll learn more about that
next, after a knowledge check!




Assessing School-Family-Community Partnerships
Checking the Pulse on Partnerships  
You don't set off with the roadmap and your travel companions and never check in with either
again. You periodically check the roadmap and ask your company how they're doing and what
they need! Once school-family-community partnerships are in place, the next step is to
determine their effectiveness and if goals are being met.  To do this, there are many available
resources. Let’s review some of those now! 
PBIS Assessments
While this resource is provided by the national center for PBIS, it can also be used in any school
that involves school-family-community partnerships. This assessment measures: 
- Connections
- Shared Decision Making
- Expectations
- Discipline Systems
- Satisfaction
- Your Perspectives
Surveys like these can be integral in producing data that can inform decisions. They provide
families and educators conﬁdential or anonymous ways to express their needs and can function
as an objective accountability measure. 

PBISApps
PBISApps empower educators to make data-driven decisions in real time for
the best student outcomes. The SWIS Suite: Powerhouse reports for schools.
PBIS Assessment: Measure effectiveness and school climate for free. PBIS
Evaluation: Reports for districts, regions & states.

Measures of Partnerships
Another tool for measuring the strength of your partnerships comes from the Wisconsin
Department of Public Instruction. This rubric-style assessment includes questions about
parenting and family skills, communicating, learning at home, volunteering, decision making,
and collaborating with the community. This may sound familiar—this rubric is based on the
same six activities of parental involvement discussed in the beginning of this lesson!   

Flamboyan Center 
This rubric was designed by the Flamboyan Center and rooted in research. It provides an in-
depth list of objectives for family and school engagement. There are three main components to
this rubric: a welcoming and engaged culture, supporting student achievement, and investing
families and community partners in student success. Each of these areas have more objectives,
as you can see in the rubric!  

FACE Rubric
This is another rubric designed to assess implementation of school-family-community
partnerships in an MTSS framework. The rubric is broken down and scored in six major
components:  
- Leadership
- Data-informed Goals and Outcomes
- Multidimensional/multi-tiered Approach
- Empowering Families
- Collaborative Problem-solving
This rubric also provides in-depth examples for the various levels of proﬁciency in each of
these components. This rubric can be used to assess your school, as well as to review what
higher levels of proﬁciency at each level might look like.   

Looking at these rubrics or assessments can feel intimidating, especially if school-family-
community partnerships are a new area of focus in your school. Remember, these rubrics
and assessments are goalposts to strive for, not to expect from the beginning! Give
yourself and your school grace as your work towards those. It’s progress, not perfection. 

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- Schools, families, and communities have the common goal of supporting children's
academic success and can make strong teams to help meet this goal
- Family engagement in the school setting is supported by research and policy
recommendations
- There are many systems for implementing family engagement, including the Dual
Capacity-Building Framework
- MTSS provides a structure for enacting family engagement across tiered levels of
support
- Assessments can help you and your school determine areas of strengths and needs
to support effective engagement with families and communities

respecting diverse identities 
2. Differentiate between cultural competence, cultural humility, and cultural
responsiveness

The School Setting
A Rich Tapestry
As Maya Angelou, acclaimed author and poet, described, in the school setting, individuals'
identities are complex and made of many components. The school setting comprises a diverse
range of individuals, encompassing students, teachers, administrators, and staff members who
all are part of the school community.  
Students, the heart and soul of any school, represent a rich tapestry of individuals with different
backgrounds, interests, and aspirations. They vary in age, hailing from different stages of their
educational journey, each with their own set of needs and developmental milestones. Whether
they are young learners embarking on their ﬁrst steps into formal education or seasoned
adolescents preparing for the challenges of higher education, students contribute to the vibrant
mix of personalities within the school community. 
Teachers, as the guiding force in the educational process, bring their expertise, passion, and
dedication to the school setting. They come from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural
backgrounds, reﬂecting the broader mosaic of society. With their distinct teaching styles,
pedagogical approaches, and subject matter expertise, teachers play a crucial role in shaping
learning experiences and fostering an inclusive environment for students. 
Administrators provide the essential framework and support that enables the school to function
effectively. Their roles encompass a wide range of responsibilities, from managing resources
and coordinating programs to establishing policies and promoting a positive school culture.
Like other members of the school community, administrators contribute their unique identities
and experiences, inﬂuencing decision-making processes and fostering an environment
conducive to growth and learning. 
The dedicated staff members behind the scenes play an integral part in maintaining the smooth
operation of the school. From custodial staff ensuring a clean and safe environment to cafeteria
workers providing nourishment to students, these individuals contribute their skills and
expertise to the overall wellbeing of the school community. They too have their own diverse
identities, adding to the richness and inclusivity of the school environment. 
Overall, in the school setting, individual’s identities are complex and made of many
components, including:
age
race 
ethnicity 
gender
religious beliefs
political beliefs
primary language 
ability or disability status
...and many more. Identities are important because they shape our experiences, perspectives,
and values. When these experiences and perspectives are valued and respected, everyone is able
to feel welcomed and contribute to the school community.  
We all should know that diversity makes for a rich
tapestry, and we must understand that all the threads of
the tapestry are equal in value no matter what their color.
Maya Angelou
Another important component to acknowledge about identity is the concept of intersectionality.
This term, coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, refers to multiple, overlapping identities and the
impact of this overlap on someone's experiences. For example, a person may be Hispanic and a
Christian. Together, these two identities impact the person's perspective and experience as they
interact with each other, making an identity that is different from someone who is Hispanic and
a different religion, or Christian and a different ethnicity.  
When thinking about identities, it is important to recognize that having a multitude of identities
is a strength to have in the community and in schools. For student and school success, it is
essential to have an environment that is open and accepting to all. Beyond the mere presence of
different identities existing in a community, everyone's full participation being expected,
equally welcomed, and valued creates a strong and successful environment. 
Research shows that communities with many identities are more innovative, have better
educational outcomes, and show stronger critical thinking skills (Offce of Planning,
Evaluation, and Policy Development Offce of the Under Secretary U.S. Department of Education
November 2016).  
When differences in schools are respected and valued, strong and supportive communities are
cultivated. 
Given the great number of different identities in the school setting, it is important to
intentionally ensure that all identities feel supported and welcomed. Cultural competence,
humility, and responsiveness help to achieve this goal.


Cultural Competence, Humility, and Responsiveness
Fostering Inclusive Practices
Understanding the differences between cultural competence, humility, and responsiveness is
essential for creating a truly inclusive and supportive school community. Each of these
principles brings a unique perspective and set of skills that contribute to building positive
relationships, promoting understanding, and valuing diversity. By recognizing these
distinctions, educators and individuals within the school setting can effectively navigate the
complexities of identities, address biases and stereotypes, and cultivate an environment where
every individual feels respected, valued, and able to fully participate. Therefore, gaining insights
into the nuances of cultural competence, humility, and responsiveness is vital to foster an
inclusive and equitable educational experience for all.

CULTURAL COMPETENCE
Cultural competence is a broad concept that aims to increase a person’s ability to interact
effectively with people of various backgrounds. Cultural competence is important in any ﬁeld and
can be used as a tool to improve outcomes in a school setting as well.     
Cultural competence implies a level of proﬁciency at which a person no longer needs to continue
learning, and it assumes that one can be competent in a culture in the same way that one may be
proﬁcient in a foreign language or driving a car. However, there are some limitations to cultural
competence. For example, the reality of working with people from diverse backgrounds is that
the lines between ‘competent’ and ‘incompetent’ may not be so clear or straightforward. Another
concern with the phrase cultural competence is that competent can imply that the person or
professional is an ‘expert’ on the culture of others, which could be inaccurate. As diversity
continues to grow and cultures continue to change, knowledge continues to need to be adjusted.  

CULTURAL HUMILITY
Cultural humility responds to the concerns of cultural competence by modifying the idea of
competence to humility. Cultural humility involves fostering an open-mindedness to cultures,
with an awareness of your own background and how it inﬂuences your perspective. Cultural
humility is more ﬂexible and implies an ongoing process of learning and considering new
viewpoints from other people, without a belief that any culture may be superior or inferior.

CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS
Cultural responsiveness is one of the key components of Multi-tiered System of Supports (MTSS)
and involves adapting practices to meet the cultural needs of people being served. In the school
setting, staff and teachers use culturally responsive practices when they “strive to learn and value
their students’ culture as situated within historical and current sociopolitical contexts to inform
their instruction, scaffold student learning, and sustain students’ culture” (Ladson-Billings,
2014).  This means that culturally responsive education considers students' backgrounds,
understanding that this inﬂuences their perspective and their needs in the school setting. All
students need to be valued, respected, and understood to be successful, and cultural
responsiveness helps to achieve this goal. 
There are many ways to include culturally responsive practices in the school setting. An article by
Kressler, et al (2019) recommends four components of culturally responsive problem-solving to
consider: 
- use data-informed decision making — consider both qualitative and quantitative data when
making decisions
- adapt interventions to cultural needs or consider alternative interventions 
- look for disconnects between student and school cultures  
- examine assessments to ensure they are culturally appropriate 
Again, equity and inclusion are central to cultural responsiveness. What works best for a student
with one background may not be the best for another, and it is important to value and respect
these differences in practice.

Equity and Disproportionality in the School Setting
Breaking Down the Imbalance
With the values of cultural competence, humility, and responsiveness in mind, let’s look at
some of the challenges they can help address. Let’s begin with an understanding of some
essential concepts: equity and disproportionality.

Equity
Equity is an important issue that can be addressed with cultural competence, humility, and
responsiveness. One way to deﬁne equity comes from the Council of Chief State School Offcers
(CCSSO,2021), which states that equity is when: “every student has access to the educational
resources and rigor they need at the right moment in their education across race, gender,
ethnicity, language, disability, sexual orientation, family background and/or family income”
(p.3).   
At its core, this means that equity is providing students with unique supports based on their
individual needs. Importantly, equity must be distinguished from equality, which provides
everyone with the same supports. To illustrate the difference, examine the pictures below:
	In these images adapted from Shel Silverstein's "The Giving Tree" (1964), you can see that
there is a marked difference between “equality” and “equity.” In the image for equality, both
children are given the same ladder, but one side of the tree is higher than the other. In this
scenario, one of the children still cannot reach the fruit. In the picture depicting equity, this
child is given a taller ladder so that they can reach the fruit as effectively as the other child.  
Issues of equity compared to equality can also exist in the school environment. Education is not
always a level playing ﬁeld; student backgrounds and identities are all different, yet the
curriculum is generally the same for everyone. This can create challenges for students. 
For example, let's consider a history teacher who is administering an exam. One student in this
class may have been diagnosed with attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In a
classroom emphasizing equality, all students would take the same test under the same time
constraints and in the same location. For a student with ADHD, this may result in too many
distractions or a time frame that isn’t long enough to complete the test, which may negatively
impact their performance. In an equitable classroom, the student may have the option to take
the exam with extended time, or in an environment with fewer distractions, in order to level the
playing ﬁeld.   
To illustrate, Kimberlé Crenshaw, lawyer, and civil rights advocate, highlights the importance of
recognizing and addressing the unique needs and circumstances of individual students, such as
providing accommodations or adjustments that promote equity in the learning environment in
the quote below.
Treating different things the same can generate as much
inequality as treating the same things differently. 
Kimberlé Crenshaw
Therefore, it is crucial to strive for equitable practices that acknowledge and respond to the
diverse needs and experiences of students, fostering an inclusive and supportive educational
environment.

Deﬁning Disproportionality
While equity is ideal in the school setting, it may be diffcult to achieve. When equity is not
achieved, this is called disproportionality. Disproportionality is a difference in outcomes based
on certain factors. In a school setting, “having signiﬁcant disproportionality means that
students of a particular race/ethnicity are signiﬁcantly more likely than their other-race peers
to be identiﬁed as students with disabilities, identiﬁed in a particular disability category, placed
in a particular educational setting, or suspended/expelled as a disciplinary measure.” (National
Center for Learning Disabilities, 2020). In this lesson, you will examine two key components of
disproportionality in the school setting: 
1. Special Education Identiﬁcation
2. Discipline Disparities
Let’s examine each component!

Special Education Identiﬁcation
The identiﬁcation of students for special education is a complex process that involves assessing
various aspects of a student's needs, abilities, and learning challenges. However, this process
can be inﬂuenced by certain factors that result in disproportionality, where certain groups of
students are overrepresented or underrepresented in special education programs compared to
their representation in the overall student population. 
Disproportionality in special education identiﬁcation has been a longstanding concern,
particularly when it relates to subjective diagnoses. It highlights the need for cultural
competence and humility within the assessment and placement process. When cultural
competence and humility are not effectively incorporated into the special education
identiﬁcation process, there is a risk of biases and stereotypes inﬂuencing decision-making.
This can result in the misidentiﬁcation or under identiﬁcation of students from culturally
diverse backgrounds, leading to disparities in access to appropriate educational support. It is
crucial for educators and professionals involved in special education to be aware of these
potential pitfalls and strive to approach the identiﬁcation process with sensitivity, fairness, and
an understanding of the intersecting identities and experiences of students. 
By promoting cultural competence and humility in special education, professionals can enhance
their ability to accurately identify students' needs, provide targeted support, and reduce
disparities. Emphasizing the importance of understanding cultural nuances and recognizing the
potential for bias and disproportionality contributes to fostering an inclusive and equitable
educational environment, where every student's unique strengths and challenges are
acknowledged and addressed. 
Click through the items on the graphic below to explore
some qualifying diagnoses covered under IDEA:
Speciffc learning disability:
Specific learning disability is a broad category that includes disorders affecting a child's ability to read,
write, or do math, such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, or dyscalculia.
Other health impairment:
Other health impairments include various disorders that can impact a child's ability to learn, such as
ADHD. 
Autism spectrum disorder:
Autism spectrum disorder is a wide spectrum of developmental disability that can look different in each
child diagnosed with it, but it generally impacts social skills and behavior. 
Emotional disturbance:
Emotional disturbance can refer to various disorders impacting mood, such as anxiety or depression.
Speech or language impairment:
Speech or language impairments are any disabilities that impact a child's ability to talk or understand
language, such as speech sound disorder, articulation disorder, or receptive language disorder.
Visual impairment:
Visual impairments involve problems with vision that impact academic performance, such as blindness or
partial blindness (note: this doesn't include visual problems that can be corrected with glasses, such as
astigmatism or near-sightedness).
Blind-deafness:
This category describes children who meet the diagnosis of blindness and deafness.
Deafness:
This category fits children who have been diagnosed with deafness. Usually, this diagnosis is made by a
pediatrician or other medical professional.
Hearing impairment:
Hearing impairment applies to children who have hearing difficulties other than deafness.
Orthopedic impairment:
Orthopedic impairment is a disability relating to movement. Some examples include cerebral palsy, spina
bifida, muscular dystrophy, or multiple sclerosis.
Intellectual disability:
Intellectual disability involves difficulty learning and processing information, difficulties with social
interactions or abstract thought, delayed development, or difficulties with self-care activities. Intellectual
disability can be related to many disorders, such as Down syndrome, and can range from mild to severe.
Traumatic brain injury:
Traumatic brain injury results from especially damaging injuries to the brain and skull, such as those from
a car accident. These injuries can impact cognition, concentration, or development. The severity of
traumatic brain injury can vary and result in different impacts. 
Multiple disabilities:
Students can also be impacted by multiple disabilities at the same time. For example, a student might be
diagnosed with ADHD and depression. These two disabilities together may need unique support compared
to each one individually.

When considering referring students to special education, use the student's context to view
them holistically. There are many potential explanations for a student's diffculties or
challenges in the classroom, and these may or may not be related to the disability categories
described above. Because of possible alternative explanations, it is always crucial to consider
what may be causing a student's diffculties in the classroom when considering special
education services. While many students do need access to special education, it may not be the
right ﬁt for other students. Misidentiﬁcation can result in:   
- Not providing the right supports or addressing the true root of the issue
- Students missing opportunities for exposure to rigorous curriculum
- Inappropriate lowering of expectations for the student because of the stigma of a
special education label
- Lowering of self-esteem for students
- Increasing racial disparities when students of marginalized races are more often
misidentiﬁed
When students are identiﬁed for special education, it can also inﬂuence the likelihood that they
will be placed in more restrictive settings, with discrepancies between students with special
needs being placed in self-contained classrooms and being integrated into general education
classrooms (National Center for Learning Disabilities, 2020). This is a problem because
research supports the inclusion of students with special needs in general education classrooms:
it improves academic outcomes, provides socialization opportunities, provides all students the
opportunity to access challenging material, and increases the diversity of the classroom.   
When considering special education identiﬁcation and placement, it is important to remember
our key value of equity: providing students with the support that meets their individual needs.
Special education services are extremely valuable and can help level the playing ﬁeld for
students who are correctly identiﬁed; however, it can also be damaging to students who are
misidentiﬁed. 

Discipline Disparities
It is also essential to address the issue of discipline disparities in order to promote a fair and
inclusive educational environment. There are also signiﬁcant disproportionalities in student
discipline, particularly for exclusionary discipline.  
Exclusionary discipline refers to any discipline that removes students from the classroom, such
as suspensions or expulsions. This type of discipline is susceptible to disproportionality,
particularly for students with disabilities or from marginalized races.
When assessing the use of exclusionary discipline practices, it is important to note that these
practices: 
- Are unlikely to improve behavior
- Do not teach replacement behaviors; instead of teaching students what to do, it
- only teaches what not to do
- Increase the likelihood of students being held back or dropping out
- Lead to missed instructional time for students
- Lead to a student's perceptions of not belonging in the school system
- Increase the likelihood of students entering the juvenile justice system
Despite these issues in the use of exclusionary discipline, it is still an extremely common
practice. By the time of high school graduation, 1 in 3 students will have been suspended or
expelled.  
Nationwide data reﬂects trends of disproportionality in the use of exclusionary discipline
practices. Data collected by the United States Department of Education highlights discrepancies
by gender, race, and disability status. 
To review the data in detail, select the links below.

A review of the nationwide data provided by the U.S. Department of Education's Offce for Civil
Rights illustrates:
Stark contrasts for gender: 
While boys make up 51.4% of student enrollment, they make up 69.5% of in-school
suspensions, 70.5% of out-of-school suspensions, and 72.7% of expulsions.  
Imbalances in race, particularly for African American students:  
While African American boys make up 7.7% of enrollment, they make up 20.1% of in-
school suspensions, 25% of out-of-school suspensions, and 26% of expulsions: this is
more than triple their enrollment percentage. There is a similar disproportionality for
African American girls; while African American girls make up 7.4% of enrollment, they
make up 11.2% of in-school suspensions, 13.3% of out-of-school suspensions, and 11.8%
of expulsions.  
Staggering data for children with disabilities:
While students with disabilities comprise 15.9% of the student population, they account
for 28% of out-of-school suspensions.  
African American students make up 17.7% of students receiving disability supports, but
35.7% of out-of-school suspensions. This shows evidence of intersectionality: the two
identities of race and disability status together can inﬂuence students' educational
outcomes. 

Reﬂection
Now that you have reviewed some disproportionality data, consider the
following questions: 
- Did any of the data surprise you? Why or why not?
- How do you think your school compares to the nationwide data?
- Does your MTSS team have plans for responding to disproportionality if
 it is indicated in the data?
Implementing data-driven decision making is one of the ﬁrst steps districts and schools can
take to address disproportionality and create a more equitable and inclusive learning
environment for all students. School districts can: 
- Regularly collect and analyze data related to student outcomes, discipline, and
 access to educational opportunities. 
- Identify patterns of disproportionality and use the data to inform targeted
 interventions and support systems. 
- Monitor progress and make adjustments to strategies based on ongoing data
 analysis.

address disproportionality within your district or school
team, download and review the Center for PBIS Guide
below. 



How Does MTSS Help Support Cultural Competence?
Exploring the Role of MTSS in Supporting Equitable and Inclusive Practices
There are several reasons why MTSS is a good tool for intentionally addressing potential bias or
disproportionality in the school setting.
- Emphasis on culturally responsive assessments and interventions  
- Promotion of proactive, preventive, early intervention  
- Reliance on data-informed decision making 
- Emphasis on high-quality and evidence-based practices
- Team-based decision making and strong leadership
- Professional development for addressing biases and use of evidence-based
 culturally responsive practice

Cultural Responsiveness in MTSS
Earlier, you learned about cultural responsiveness and how it can be used to support positive
outcomes for all students. One multi-tiered system speciﬁc to behavior is Positive Behavior
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) as outlined in the “All Hands on Deck” course. There are
several components to successfully implementing culturally responsive PBIS (Leverson, et al.,
2021). While these are presented as characteristics of PBIS, they are relevant features of any
well-functioning MTSS.
Click through the following tabs to review key features.

IDENTITY
To promote effective interactions and understanding, it is crucial for practitioners in the school
setting, such as teachers, administrators, and mental health clinicians, to recognize their own
identities and perspectives. Similarly, students' identities encompass various aspects, including
race, ethnicity, ability status, religion, language, and more, which should be understood beyond
categorization. It is important to separately identify the unique identities of students' families.
Considering the broader community's identities, beliefs, values, and the school's relationship with
it helps establish partnerships and comprehend students' backgrounds. This understanding
enables schools to foster connections with community organizations and acknowledge the
contextual factors inﬂuencing students' experiences. 

VOICE
Giving all community members involved in the school a voice is important to ensure that all
perspectives are considered and valued. Diversity exists in communities, so it is important to
make sure that all voices are included. As stated by EdWeek.org (2018), "Education is strongest
when diverse perspectives and voices are shared and heard in settings of learning and
development. In the classroom and the surrounding community, a rich educational opportunity is
available to those who are able to create an environment in which varying ideas and insights built
on broad backgrounds can make themselves known." By embracing and amplifying diverse
voices, schools can create an environment that fosters a robust educational experience and
embraces the wealth of perspectives within the community.
Voices can be included in activities like the school Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or volunteer
events, where families can engage with the school in leadership roles. It is also important to
consider two-way communication: schools do not just communicate with or ask families for
help, but, rather, families can also let schools know how to best support them.

SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT
A supportive environment is one of the foundations of successful MTSS. This means that there is a
system for creating a positive school culture. Positive school culture is neither punitive nor
restrictive at its foundation. An example of a supportive and positive environment is teaching
appropriate replacement behaviors when problem behaviors arise in students, rather than simply
punishing the problem behavior. A supportive environment allows all students to feel welcomed
and promotes belonging. 

SITUATIONAL APPROPRIATENESS
Situational appropriateness refers to the mindset that different behaviors are needed in different
situations, and support of positive behavior involves teaching students which situations require
which behaviors. 
Some behaviors that are perceived as problematic by school staff may be the result of a cultural
mismatch between the school and the student.
To help with this issue, schools can assess the values and expectations of the community when
establishing school-wide behavior expectations. Then, they can adjust school policies to be in line
with these values or indicate clearly to students when the expectations of the school may differ
from their home environments.
Situational appropriateness helps foster inclusivity. When students and communities have their
values represented in the school setting, it shows that they are appreciated members of the
collective.
 
 
While MTSS provides structures that can help reduce disproportionality, individuals can also
take steps to reduce this issue. One way to do this is by measuring our own implicit bias and
build self-awareness through taking an Implicit Association Test (IAT).   
Use the link below to navigate to the "Project Implicit Health" (PIH) website where you will ﬁnd
15 IATs. Complete a test of your choice, then consider the questions in the next reﬂection
activity.
Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, or prejudices that affect our
perceptions, actions, and decisions without our conscious awareness. These biases are
deeply ingrained and can inffuence our judgments and behaviors towards certain
individuals or groups, often leading to unintended discrimination or unequal treatment. 

Implicit Bias Reﬂection
 Stones reﬂected in water 
After taking one of the Implicit Association Tests (IAT), reﬂect on the following questions: 
- Did your test results surprise you? Why or why not?
- How might the results of this test impact your interactions in the school setting?
- What action steps can you take moving forward based on the results of this test?
These reﬂection questions are designed to encourage self-awareness and deepen your
understanding of your own biases and attitudes. It is important to approach these questions
with an open mind and without judgment. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers
here. The goal is to gain insights into yourself in order to better understand and support your
students. Take your time to contemplate these questions and consider how you can apply your
newfound awareness to create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment. 
Now, let's further explore the topic of biases and
attitudes by watching a thought-provoking video
featuring diversity advocate Vernā Myers. In this video,
Myers delves into the realm of subconscious attitudes
and biases that one often unknowingly holds.

The intention of the video was to offer valuable insights and spark deeper reﬂection on the
subconscious attitudes and biases one may possess. Remember, understanding and addressing
these biases is a continuous journey toward fostering a more inclusive and equitable school
environment.

Recommendations and Additional Resources for Equity and Inclusion in Education 
While MTSS practices can help address issues of disparities and inequities, it is imperative that
districts and schools intentionally attend to these issues via policies and procedures. Below are
policy recommendations that address disproportionality and other inequities and help create
school-community environments where all students thrive.

Speciffc Commitment to Equity –
A speciﬁc commitment to equity is a key recommendation for policies regarding
disproportionality. This commitment can be present in the mission statement of a school or
district, a separate statement in policies, or it can be in both. It is important to be clear and
speciﬁc about what is meant by equity in the school or district.   
Here is an example school statement showing a speciﬁc commitment to equity provided by the
PBIS Center (Green, et al., 2015):
“Example High School is committed to high expectations, varied and challenging experiences
relevant for each student, positive and proactive discipline practices, and educational equity for
all students. We are committed to identifying strengths and addressing improvements in the
operations of our school through the continuous use of data as an effort to honor each
component of our mission.”

Family Partnerships in Policy Development –
Including families is another way to promote equity through school policies. Having policies that
speciﬁcally encourage and facilitate the involvement of families ensures that cultural
perspectives are considered and valued.   
Here is an example family partnership policy statement (Green, et al., 2015):   
“One of our primary goals at Example School is to ensure that parents and community members
have opportunities to assist and support the educational process through participation in decision
making, school governance, and volunteer activities. It is our desire to include parents and
community members as an integral part of our students’ learning process. With that said,
Example School has jointly developed with parents, students, and staff a Parent/School Compact,
which outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will work together to ensure our
school maintains a welcoming and positive learning environment that promotes student
success.”

Focus on Implementing Positive, Proactive Behavior Support Practices –
A third way to support equity is to focus behavior management strategies on the prevention of
problem behaviors rather than intervention after the fact. Using this strategy, school staff set
clear, fair expectations and provide a school culture that encourages and teaches positive
behavior. 
Here is an example school procedure indicating this (Green, et al., 2015): 
“Example High School will maintain a positive environment by providing ongoing instruction
and reinforcement of appropriate social and behavior interactions within the school community.
As a school, behavior expectations will be systematically taught in classrooms and in the
common areas (e.g., cafeteria, gym, library) during the ﬁrst two weeks of school, and again in
January when students return from winter break. Throughout the school year, students will
receive positive reinforcement for displaying expected behaviors and reteaching of appropriate
behaviors when those expectations are not met.”

Clear, Objective Discipline Procedures –
To promote equity, schools must clearly deﬁne discipline procedures. 
As mentioned earlier, behavior can be subjective; a problem behavior in one environment may
not be considered a problem behavior in another, and cultural values not only inﬂuence behavior
but also how it is interpreted. To prevent these factors from contributing to inequities, clear
deﬁnitions of positive and negative behavior should be provided to teachers and students, as well
as what indicates a minor or major behavioral concern. 
Review this example to see these principles in action (Green, et al., 2015):  
“The teachers and administrators at Example School have procedures for identifying and
responding to behavior incidents in our building and review them formally on a regular basis. Our
orientation materials and school website include deﬁnitions for the most common problem
behaviors we see in our school, as well as examples of how these behaviors can range from
minor, staff-managed behaviors to major, offce-managed behaviors.” 

Removal or Reduction of Exclusionary Discipline Practices –
As discussed previously, exclusionary discipline practices can contribute to inequity because they
remove students from the classroom, further disrupting the student’s education and
contributing to feelings of exclusion from the school system. They are also frequently
disproportionately applied. To prevent the negative impact of exclusionary discipline practices,
schools can adopt policies that limit their use as much as possible.   
For example, a school could propose (Green et al., 2015):  
“For serious behavior incidents that do not require mandatory expulsion, Example Elementary
School’s multi-disciplinary team will determine appropriate interventions in lieu of out-of-
school suspension. Students who are involved in behavior incidents in this category are required
to participate in activities designed to support development of prosocial skills. See our Graduated
Discipline Policy for alternative responses.” 

Graduated Discipline Systems with Instructional Alternatives to Exclusion –
The next step in reducing exclusionary discipline is to provide alternatives. All problem behaviors
should be addressed, but not all behaviors warrant removal from the classroom environment.
 Deﬁning and categorizing behaviors based on level of severity assists with reduction of
exclusionary discipline.  A graduated system does this by classifying behavior events based on
their severity, leaving only the most severe for exclusionary discipline and responding to
relatively minor incidents through other options.
Here is a sample district policy supporting this concept:  
“Example District believes in the use of graduated discipline to ensure severe punishments, such
as exclusion from the learning environment, are reserved for credible threats to the safety of
others. The goal of all discipline responses is to ensure students understand the school’s behavior
expectations, repair the harm caused by their choice of behavior, and identify how to prevent the
problem in the future. When repeated or serious behavior incidents occur, each school’s
multidisciplinary team will conduct a functional behavior assessment for students to identify
needs for academic and behavior support.” 
When adopting this type of system, it is important to have alternatives to suspensions and
expulsions in mind. Here are a few options:  
- Restorative Justice: aims to repair any harm that is done because of a behavior. It
encourages students to self-reﬂect, empathize with those they may have harmed, and take
actions to restore the issue. An example of restorative justice may be having a student who
sprayed graffti on school property work with the custodial staff to remove it.  
- Mediation: this is another alternative to exclusionary discipline. This tool might be most
relevant for behaviors related to interpersonal conﬂicts or resulting in interpersonal harm.
This approach also encourages self-reﬂection and empathy for people who may have been
harmed as a result of a behavior.  
- Assess communication: examine communication patterns for miscommunications or
cultural mismatches between student and teacher expectations. 
- Provide redirection: redirect behavior through strategies such as a break, additional
activities, or other support.
- Teach appropriate behaviors: redeﬁne expectations as necessary, and provide positive
reinforcement for these behaviors.
- Conferences: use conferences to discuss problems with students, families, teachers, and/or
administrators.

Procedures with Accountability for Equitable Student Outcomes –
Equitable policies and procedures can also beneﬁt from providing accountability. This means that
there are clear standards and expectations in place for the policies listed above and data is used to
make decisions. Procedures with accountability:
-set goals
- outline the steps towards meeting those goals
- provide a roadmap for what is intended so that everyone knows roles and responsibilities
therein
The following is an example of procedures with clear accountability  (Green, et al., 2015):
“Goals: In alignment with our school’s mission and district equity policy, our school leadership
team’s current equity goals are: (1) provide at least two professional development opportunities
annually for teachers and administrators related to culturally responsive behavior support
practices, (2) increase the percentage of students who have positive perceptions of our school
climate to 80% across all racial/ethnic groups as measured by the annual District School Climate
Survey, (3) increase family and community involvement in school activities to 80%, (4) provide
at least one community activity/ﬁeld trip each semester, and (5) monitor disaggregated rates of
ODRs at least quarterly and reduce risk ratios to no more than 1.25 for any group.”  


Let's review the lesson.
- Cultural competence, humility, and responsiveness are key values to apply when
working in the school setting.
- Disproportionality is one issue that may arise in the school setting and often
involves disproportionate rates of exclusionary discipline and special education
identiﬁcation.
- Cultural responsiveness can help prevent disproportionality.
- When determining if disproportionality is present, it is important to use data-
informed decision making.

Universal Supports
Family & Student Engagement
Elevating Engagement in Practical Ways


@@@@@
Lesson 1 of 3: Universal Supports
Outcomes:
1. Contextualize the role and purpose of Tier 1 support within core principles of Multi-
tiered System of Supports
2. Understand the key concepts underlying Tier 1 infrastructure
3. Identify Tier 1 best practices

Tier 1 & Universal Supports,The Strong Foundation of All Supports
When skyscrapers are built, the ﬁrst step is to build a steady, fortiﬁed foundation. The
foundation of the structure is one of its most important components: everything that is built depends upon its stability and strength. The foundation supports everything else in the structure. All aspects of the building, from the ﬁrst to the top ﬂoor, begin with and depend on
the foundation. Tier 1 of the Multi-tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is the foundational level for building a
strong school community. Similar to constructing a skyscraper, a solid Tier 1 foundation offers
the essential support and stability on which every aspect of a resilient school community relies.
Having a shaky or unstable foundation can make building anything on top feel diffcult or
impossible. When a foundation is strong, building your structure can become easier and more effective—the possibilities become endless. The goal of this course is to review some of the key building blocks of Tier 1 so that your school has a solid foundation.
It’s important to note that while having a strong foundation from the start is helpful,
foundations also need to be monitored over time. Supporting Tier 1 is not a one-time endeavor,
but rather a process of building, addressing problems, and re-building over time as needed. Like
many components of MTSS, Tier 1 support is a continuous process. 
Essential to this process of building and maintaining a strong foundation is relationships:
relationships between students and educators, among educators, and among families and
communities all contribute to our ability to effectively work in Tier 1 and throughout MTSS. 


Key Principles of MTSS, A Foundational Review
MTSS is a framework approach for supporting student success in schools. MTSS includes three
levels of support: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. These tiers are differentiated based on the intensity of
support needed, allowing support to be individualized for each student depending on the
tier.MTSS aims to help all students at all times through these adaptive, continuous tiers. 
Now that you’ve reviewed the basics of the MTSS framework, click through the image below for
examples of supports that may exist at each level of the pyramid. If you’ve taken our All Hands
on Deck or Core MTSS course, these may look familiar to you!

1. School-Family-Community Partnerships
School-family-community partnerships involve families and communities working in partnerships with
schools. These partnerships help to ensure consistency across the home and school environment, increase
positive academic and behavioral outcomes for students, and build a strong community. Some examples
of school-family-community practices are parent-teacher home visits, parent IEP involvement, and
back-to-school nights.

2. Team-Based Leadership
Team-based leadership sets the stage for all levels of MTSS. Leadership teams, or MTSS teams, exist at
the district and school levels, and there may be multiple teams in each school depending on its needs.
Leadership teams work collaboratively to review data, make decisions about programming, and
implement changes as needed. 

3. Resource Mapping and Needs Assessment
Resource mapping and needs assessments are two related practices that help schools identify the needs
present in a school and the resources available to help meet those needs. This helps schools use resources
effectively to meet the needs of all students. 

4. Tiered Delivery System
The tiered delivery system underlies all aspects of MTSS. One of the benefits of a tiered delivery system is
that support can be matched to the needs of students, whatever those may be. The tiered delivery system
also allows for layering — students receiving multiple supports at the same time, such as Tier 1 and Tier 3
services. This provides a framework for ensuring that all student needs are met. 

5. Universal Screening
Screeners are assessments that are provided to all students to help identify students needing additional
support. Each school uses different screeners, but they are commonly used to assess vision and hearing,
literacy, math skills, and social-emotional health. When students receive results on screeners that indicate
concern, they may be referred to Tier 2 and/or Tier 3 services.

6. Data-informed Decision Making
Data-informed decision making is used to identify students in need of intervention, measure the
effectiveness of programs in place, and make decisions on school improvement. Data can come from
many sources: screening assessments, school records (e.g., attendance, grades, and office discipline
referrals), and observations from teachers, families, or other staff. 

7. Progress Monitoring
Progress monitoring is a process that occurs across all three tiers and uses data to measure student
progress. This process involves setting goals, collecting data, and using the data to determine if goals are
being met. Then, interventions can be modified depending on the results.

8. Cultural Humility
Cultural humility involves awareness of and responsiveness to the great amount of diversity that exists in
school communities. Some best practices for supporting cultural humility include fostering a community
of acceptance and respect, offering implicit bias training, and using disaggregated data to assess and
address disproportionality.

What is Tier 1 Support? A Closer Look at the Fundamentals of Tier 1
As mentioned earlier, this course is focused on the Tier 1 level of MTSS. Tier 1 forms the foundation of our pyramid: Tier 1 practices are universally applied and available for all students.
MTSS pyramid with Tier 1 bolded: School-wide or class-wide prevention/promotion for ALL
At their best, Tier 1 practices are  p r o a c t i v e and p r e v e n t i v e, reducing the need for Tier 2 and Tier 3
services. Tier 1 support ideally meets needs and promotes healthy development for 80-90% of
students, with 10-20% needing Tier 2 and/or Tier 3.  
To hear more about the importance of Tier 1, watch the
video below featuring Andy Sevlin, a district MTSS
coordinator.
As Andy said, ensuring a solid, effective Tier 1 is critical to prevent the “hopping” from one
crisis to another. If a signiﬁcant number of students are being identiﬁed or referred to Tier 2
and Tier 3 services, it’s important to examine your Tier 1 practices. For example, if 35% of
students have several offce discipline referrals and need behavior interventions, effective and
effcient universal practices may be missing or inadequate at Tier 1. If this is the case, below are
issues to consider:
1. Behavior expectations may not be clear to students or educators
2. Instructional practices may not be evidence-based or delivered with consistency or
ﬁdelity (i.e., as intended)
3. Additional barriers to effective practice may be contributing
In summary, if signiﬁcantly more than 20% of students in your school are receiving Tier 2 or 3
services, this calls for a review of Tier 1 practices.  

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. -Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father & Inventor
For some ideas on how to provide strong Tier 1 support, review the points below. You may
recognize some of these practices from your own school, or you may want to learn more about
them. Stay tuned for more information on each of these practices!

IMAGE HERE


List of Tier 1 best practices
Some of these practices, including but not limited to family-school home visits or schoolwide
expectations, you will learn about in later lessons in this course! For now, it is important to
know that these practices are an outcome of Tier 1’s development.




MTSS Infrastructure, Using Tier 1 Development to Strengthen the Framework
We discussed Tier 1 as the foundation of our district and school MTSS. To take this a step
further, you can think about your Tier 1 development activities as the building blocks behind the
foundation’s infrastructure. When the infrastructure is strong, Tier 1 becomes more robust and
sustainable. This may sound fantastic to you but feel vague and unattainable. You may be asking,
“How, exactly, does this happen? What does this look like in my district and school?” Don’t
worry. There are practical steps for developing Tier 1 at your school, and you can review them
below. These steps can apply to MTSS as a whole, but in this lesson, you will learn more about
them in the context of Tier 1.




Planning
When district and school teams are designing an MTSS for their populations, folks are eager
and ready to get started. This excitement is a good thing! However, it really is necessary to take
the time to plan systems on the front end. By taking steps to carefully and practically develop
programming, it is more likely that schools can follow through on plans rather than burn out
quickly. As the popular phrase goes, “Measure twice, cut once!”
Planning can take many forms. go through the cards below to learn more.

measurement tools: Use measurement tools to narrow your focus. The Self Assessment of MTSS Implementation (SAM 2.0; linked below), endorsed by the SC Department of Education, is one way to gauge your school’s MTSS functioning in 6 domains: leadership, building the capacity and/or infrastructure for implementation, communication and collaboration, data-based problem-solving, the three-tiered instructional and intervention model, and data-evaluation. 

Collaboration: Planning is done best with the input of everyone involved. You wouldn’t build a house without consulting the people who live in it, or an office without taking feedback from those working in it! Conversations with families and community members offer powerful insight into what is important to stakeholders outside the school building. Asking for their input in the planning process instead of their feedback after the fact also encourages trust and respect between schools, families, and community members! 

Data: Examine your school's discipline data thoroughly. Go beyond suspensions into offfce and classroom discipline referrals to look for patterns that need to be addressed. This can look like teacher referrals, attendance,
student self-referral, and more!


Building a System
MTSS is a framework, not a recipe. The Tier 1 system your team builds will act as the scaffolding
or structure for the interventions you choose. The interventions themselves will be unique to
your school based on your needs assessment, input from families and the community, and the
priorities of your MTSS team. For one school, increasing regular attendance may be a top
priority. At another school, teaching students to cooperate with one another may be the main
concern. Keep in mind that the concerns can shift over time. Perhaps once attendance is
addressed, another concern rises to the top. That’s okay! Because MTSS is a framework, you
can use the basic structure of the three-tiered system and adapt the interventions to what your
students, families, and school community need.
Administrators and educators often discuss scaffolding for students when it comes to building
new skills. That is, providing support to meet them where they are, and providing help as they
need it. Think of MTSS in the same way. We are providing supports for our students, families,
and school community to help build skills. MTSS is scaffolding, with interventions selected to
address speciﬁc needs.
When done well, MTSS provides a lasting structure that serves the entire school population. We
don’t want to put our energy into something that will fall to the wayside in a year or two. You
might be wondering how to tell if your school or district is working on a "project" or truly
building a system. Consider how heavily your family and community partners are involved, the
amount of focus on long-range planning, and the inclusion of periodic ﬁdelity checks to make
sure Tier 1 operations are strong. Later on in this lesson, you’ll learn about implementation with
ﬁdelity. There, you’ll ﬁnd measures and resources that will further help you answer your
questions about where your school or district is at with MTSS implementation!If we are using so much of our time, resources, and ingenuity, we want to build a system that
will improve the lives of our students and their families for years to come.


Teaming Structures
Teaming structures, or how your teams for MTSS are set up, are a key component of your MTSS.
Some schools choose to have one MTSS team to cover all students' concerns, while some
schools split their MTSS teams into “academics” and “behavior.” Your team will decide what
teaming structure makes the most sense for your group.
Let’s hear from Jodie Soracco, Director of the Virginia
Tiered Systems and Support Research and
Implementation Center, for more tips on teaming
structures.
As Jodie said, it’s crucial to think about effciency when designing
teaming structures. Look carefully before breaking off into sub-
committees and adding more meetings. With advanced planning,
sticking to an agenda, and pulling data before a meeting, you can
maximize the time you have as an MTSS team and avoid the meeting
merry-go-round.


Long Term Perspective
When developing MTSS as a school or district, it is necessary to need to factor in the amount of
time it takes to reach full implementation. Typically, this is a years-long process. Don’t be
discouraged, though! Although it may seem daunting, this long-range perspective is a good
thing. Your school or district does not need to do everything at once.
Take it one step at a time. What themes came out of your needs assessment? What are the top
concerns your MTSS team wants to address? How will this look at Tier 1? Take the time now to
focus on manageable steps towards implementation. It will all come together.

Fidelity
Fidelity of implementation might sound intimidating at ﬁrst. All this really means is that we’re
checking on ourselves to make sure we are using interventions as they were intended. Of
course, real-world conditions can’t 100% match research-level implementation, but that’s ok.
Real life is messy sometimes. We do, however, want to get as close to the original intervention
design as we can. This helps us reach our intended intervention outcomes for our students and
families. Remember that ﬁdelity checks happen at all 3 tiers of MTSS! 
Check out this video with Kaci Fleetwood, faculty at the University of Nevada-Reno and State
Coordinator for MTSS, for more about measuring ﬁdelity.
Check out this video with Kaci Fleetwood, faculty at the
University of Nevada-Reno and State Coordinator for
MTSS, for more about measuring ffdelity.
Fidelity inventories help us understand in which areas of our implementation we are doing well,
and where we can improve. Fidelity should never be an assumption, especially for interventions
that have been in place for a while. Checking on our ﬁdelity periodically, as a group, helps us all
improve and make sure our interventions are effective. If the intervention does not have the
outcome we expected, this allows us to rule out ﬁdelity as a problem.
There are a variety of ﬁdelity measures available. As mentioned earlier, the Self-Assessment
Measure (SAM 2.0) is a free tool to evaluate school-level MTSS implementation and is endorsed
by the SC State Department of Education. 

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
Here's a brief recap of what you've learned thus far today:
1. A strong Tier 1 is the foundation upon which all of MTSS can stand.
2. Tier 1 practices are preventive and proactive.
3. Developing Tier 1 involves planning, a focus on building a system and not just a "one-time project", communicating with families and community members, solidifying a teaming structure that works for your school, and a long-term
perspective.

As you know, Tier 1 support has many facets. To build your knowledge of Tier 1, you will review
the following topics in this course

Elevating Family Engagement, A Reminder from the SBHA to You
You brieﬂy learned about strengthening school-family-community partnerships in the Core
MTSS course. You've been over the theories, the motivations, and the desired outcomes. This
lesson will go even deeper into why family engagement matters and covers practical ways you,
as a member of a school system, can elevate family engagement in Tier 1. To start, let's recap
what family engagement really means.

What is Family Engagement?
The key elements in both deﬁnitions are active engagement for the betterment of student’s
lives and outcomes. Just as schools aren’t vessels only for academics, families aren’t vessels
only for nurturance and socialization. The role families play in schools cannot be overstated.
Families are the ones who get their students ready for school, pack their lunches, talk to them
about their experiences at school, check their homework, and welcome them home at the end
of the day. Caregivers are the experts on their children, and when they are partnered with
schools, they are powerful forces of change and good. Those in education know this.
Here is what Molly M. Spearman, South Carolina's Superintendent of Education from 2015-
2023, says: “Family engagement is of utmost importance in ensuring each
student has an opportunity to be college, career, and citizenship ready
upon graduation.”
As many educators know, family engagement is not easy or even straightforward! Just like each
student is unique, so is their family. It can be overwhelming to think about elevating family
engagement on your own, but this doesn’t rest on your shoulders alone.
In this lesson, we’ll review practical strategies you can use to elevate family engagement for
every student and every family. This elevation of family engagement starts with clearly
emphasizing the importance of leadership support and involvement. The demonstrated positive
outcomes family engagement has for everyone—students, staff, leadership, and you — can be
the motivation for leadership's support in this endeavor!


The Need for Leadership in Family Engagement, The Role of Leadership in Building Bridges and Breaking Barriers
School leadership builds bridges and breaks down barriers fostering strong and meaningful
connections between families and the educational community. A challenge schools frequently
face is changing from sporadic, event-based family involvement to systemic, integrated family
partnership. To facilitate this shift from one-sided communication to collaborative co-creation,
it is crucial for schools' leadership to actively take the role of bridge-builders and advocates.
Through meaningful connections between families and the educational community, school
leaders play an instrumental role in nurturing an environment that is dedicated to elevating
family engagement. 
Think about a time in your life when you or a colleague, sibling, etc., attempted to facilitate
change in the environment. Whether it was an offce-wide shift or a family policy, what
happened without support from the top? More often than not, those changes die without the
reinforcement of leadership. Leadership support is necessary to bridge the gap between family
engagement theory and reality.
Leadership supporting family engagement is necessary as they:
1. Establish conditions necessary for sustainable family engagement
2. Create expectations between families and educators
3. Provide opportunities for engagement
4. Ensure the needed resources and efforts for family engagemen
When we say leadership, you may be wondering which leadership team? School level? District
level? Indeed, it is important to talk about the different aspects of leadership in this context.
Leadership refers to both district level and school level authority, each carrying distinct
responsibilities for fostering family engagement. At the district level, leadership should ensure
resources and initiatives to facilitate family engagement. On the school level, leadership shouldt establish initiatives for sustained family engagement, set clear expectations for collaboration
between families and educators and offer opportunities for meaningful engagement.
That being said, the role of educators, staff, and families should not be forgotten. Educators and
staff contribute by actively participating in engagement initiatives, while families also play a vital
role in their commitment to fostering collaborative partnerships.


How Can Leadership Be Involved?
Leadership involvement, such as the principal and administrative team, strengthens family
engagement as a priority by explicitly integrating it into the school’s values, mission, and goals
for each academic year. It is essential to emphasize that leadership is the driving force behind
these policies and decisions, ﬁrmly establishing the framework for effective family
engagement. An example of this proactive approach can be found in South Carolina’s Marion
County School District! 
Marion County School District places “Strengthen Community” as one of their core values,
elaborating on it as, “We view education as a partnership among students, parents, families, and the community." This tangible commitment to collaboration exempliﬁes how leadership
sets the stage for fostering robust family engagement. 
This is further voiced in their Mission Statement:
When creating core values or a mission statement, leadership can include in its evaluation the
values, beliefs, attitudes, skills, and needs of families and educators. With these ﬁndings in
mind, leadership can supply opportunities for relationship building before and throughout the
school year.

Empowering Leadership: Breaking Barriers for Inclusive Family Engagement
When planning for family engagement activities, principals, administrative teams, and others in
leadership positions are the ones who allocate resources such as building space and ﬁnances,
as well as assign roles. As you will learn throughout the rest of this lesson, many families face
barriers to engaging as partners with schools at events. Some of these barriers are adequate
space for meetings, provision for childcare or food, and availability of faculty to staff the event.
Because school leadership is responsible for allocating resources, their support is crucial to
remove these barriers. Go through below to see some practical examples.
Creating standards for educators to meet for family engagement both on and off school property.
Examples: Timelines to call each student’s family during summer and start of school year and to complete
home visits.
Compensating families
Compensation for families on Tier 1 teams or on any leadership team where other participants are within
their employed roles or compensated positions.
Establishing rooms designated for family engagement
Example: Assigning different classrooms as different meeting points, such as Mr. Bartlett's classroom for
9th grade parents, Ms. Jenkins' classroom for 4th grade parents, and the auditorium for schoolwide
meetings.
Creating opportunities for educators to engage with families
Examples: Set days for home visits or off-property visits, and gas compensation.
Setting aside funds and resources for food and transportation
Examples: Buses for picking up families, gas station gift cards for families coming from over a certain
distance away, and a food budget.

Individuals with such a high role of inﬂuence can leverage the abilities of each staff and faculty
member, student, and family to support student outcomes within Tier 1. 
Involving leadership at Tier 1 with family engagement requires both adaptive and technical
leadership.
Adaptive Leadership: “who, what, why” leaders who focus on the big picture, motivation,
and goals.
Technical Leadership: “how and when” leaders who support the procedures necessary to
implement the decided-upon practices (Eagle et al., 2015).
Can you identify a person or group of people who can clearly see a larger vision? What about
individuals who see the short-term step-by-step needs to be met to achieve an overarching
goal? Are you either type? When elevating family engagement, both are needed!
It can be easy to put the "why" and "how" for family engagement into words. It's much more
diffcult to put these practices into action.
Don’t worry. We will see examples of this later on!
A Reminder
It may feel overwhelming to spend signiﬁcant amounts of energy, time, and strategy on
changing or adapting an entire system. Remind yourself and your leaders that a Multi-Tiered
System of Supports (MTSS) is not a destination but a journey that evolves over time. Systematic
change is slow and deliberate. If family engagement is a struggle at your school, do not lose
heart! Each small step is still a step forward. 
!What matters when getting leadership on board is not perfection but
persistence.
Putting signiﬁcant amounts of time, energy, and resources into family engagement can feel like
a big task. Reviewing the beneﬁts for families and students can remind everyone why it matters,
and that's where we're headed now

The Beneffts of Family Engagement, Why Family Engagement Matters for All-Educators, Families, and Students
When families are engaged within a school, it promotes alignment between the two on their
values, expectations, and desires for students. For families with minority backgrounds,
authentic engagement rooted in shared stories leads to more comfort with educators. Engaged
families hold higher aspirations for their children, have better communication with their kids,
and have a more favorable view of their child’s educator (Baker et al., 2016).
Family engagement becomes empowerment; families become more conﬁdent in their own
capabilities to help their children as students and to understand the educational system. They
also gain a better understanding of how they ﬁt in with their child’s education. One study with
keep track
Provide resources to facilitate engagement, such as a
room, food, and transportation via gas station cardsover 50 interviews and focus groups between students, families, and staff, found that family
engagement built capacity in families to help with English-speaking, math, and leadership
skills (Westrich & Strobel, 2013). This beneﬁts teachers too: staff reported an eased workload,
reduced disciplinary issues, and improved school unity, morale, and quality when families were
engaged. Teachers with engaged parents feel more supported in their own work with students. 
Every family, every student, and every educator beneﬁts from family-school engagement at
Tier 1, and having Tier 1 family engagement supports the more specialized engagements at
tiers 2 and 3.

TABLE HERE


You now have a clearer picture of why family engagement matters to everyone — leadership,
educators, staff, families, and students. Let’s brieﬂy review the barriers that make family
engagement diffcult outlined in the image below!


Barriers families and educators face when trying to engage
IMAGE HERE

These are a few of the common barriers that you've most likely already experienced as an
educator. The good news is that we’re here to offer solutions for overcoming these obstacles!
As we pivot to practical strategies to elevate family engagement at Tier 1, let’s ﬁrst frame
ourselves within South Carolina’s Department of Education’s standards for family engagement.


Engaging with Families We Find Diffcult to Engage:
Family engagement would be easy if each educator and each family were motivated to work with
one another as equal partners.
However, we know that isn’t always the case.
Some families and educators resist engagement, and some relationships between educators and
families are fractured.
Signiﬁcant barriers impede engagement for families and educators, and trying to use the same
tools we use with already engaged families won’t be as effective if we don’t speciﬁcally address
the needs of each family. In this section, you are going to look at two types of specialized
engagement:
engaging families that are historically marginalized, ignored, or unreached by the school
engaging families that have a fractured relationship with the school



Engaging with Families Marginalized from the School Community:
Deﬁning a family that proves challenging to involve is signiﬁcant; biases and preconceptions
arise upon encountering terms like "disengaged families," "at-risk families," and
"marginalized families." Bemak and Cornely (2002) draw a line here, separating families
integrated within the school community from those on its periphery. The former are proactive
and vocal, whereas the latter are often seen as historically inaccessible, distant, or removed
from the school.
Let’s be abundantly clear here: this distance is nota character judgment
of the family but the reality of the multifaceted barriers in their way. 

You have already reviewed the common barriers families and educators face when trying to elevate family engagement. Other key barriers are listed below.
1) Low income or unexpected drop in income; personal debt; unemployment
2) Emotional unavailability due to mental health or life experiences; fear of violence
from partner; overwhelmed by childrearing; lack of trust that educators understand
their unique needs
3) Disabilities; alcohol and substance abuse
4) Experiences of racism, sexism, homophobia; discrimination; historically negative
experiences with educational systems
These barriers are not a reﬂection of families' desires or their relationship to their child. We
have to remember what Harper and Mapp said so clearly in 2006:
We have to absolutely believe in our soulsthat families want to support their
children.”
Harper and Mapp, 2006


You are now going over a few commonly experienced methods to engage marginalized families.
Keep the following statement in mind as we look at these strategies: To engage families in a
school context, sometimes you need to respond to their needs outside of the school. Let's start!

1) Food & Transportation–
Families who wrestle with food insecurity can beneﬁt from a program such as “Backpack
Bakers," where families in the district donate canned food and personal hygiene items to be
distributed to school families or students in need within the school. This is also a great way to
engage with community partners such as local businesses or faith-based institutions!
Transportation can be extremely diffcult for families. Use school buses to pick up families for
school-wide events or offer gas gift cards for families. With leadership support, a budget can be
set for transportation costs or standards for cents per mile.
2) Childcare & Time–
Host events that align with what a family would already be doing. For example, dinner typically
occurs between 6:00-8:00 PM. For families with multiple children, leaving certain kids at home
to visit one child’s school can be diffcult in terms of childcare or feeding them. Hosting events
such as a fundraiser or teacher-parent meeting at a local restaurant, such as Chick-ﬁl-A®, Cicis
Pizza™, etc., can be a great middle-ground because the entire family can have dinner while also
being engaged. This can also happen within a school where food is provided by leadership,
catered by a restaurant, or made by families on the school board or PTA.
3) Communication–
Communication ought to be accessible for all. Families that don’t speak English as a ﬁrst
language can especially struggle in school settings. Host events in their ﬁrst language if you have
a prominent number of families with another ﬁrst language and include a translator at school-
wide events. While translators are great, hiring personnel who are bilingual or multilingual can
provide even more comfort to families knowing that their students, as well as themselves, are
connected to a school that has more routine accessibility. You want to avoid using students as
their families’ translator, as this can create confusing roles for them in the situation. Further,
ensure that all signs and paperwork are offered in multiple languages. It may also be helpful to
have bilingual staff greeting families dropping children off.

In addition to incorporating other languages, adapt communication to meet the cultural norms
and practices of families. Some families prefer texting only after school hours with no calls unless
for emergencies. Others want a formal conference instead of an informal conversation and vice
versa. Make sure that interactions are happening with the appropriate family member, such as a
family whose grandmother is signiﬁcantly involved in the student’s education.

Some families may not have access to reliable internet or strong cellular data, limiting their
access to emails texts, or phone calls. Further, notes sent home can be a barrier depending on
literacy levels. To overcome these challenges and prevent frustration over a lack ofcommunication, use physical home visits where communication preferences and needs can be
discussed. This can also be accomplished at school during events. To protect against
forgetfulness and provide expectations for communication, give parents a syllabus at the start of
the semester that includes a communication plan that is signed by both families and students. 
4) Representation–
Families with culturally, racially, or ethnically diverse backgrounds value their representation in
the school setting (Hopper, 2020). This includes positions in staff, faculty, and membership
among leadership teams or focus groups, and at events like International Night.
As previously mentioned, families are more likely to believe that leadership cares about their
stories and background when they are aware that staff and faculty are taking continuing
education courses or workshops on their culture. Hiring diverse staff is not enough in and of
itself; faculty and staff need to be aware of family needs and how to practically respond to them.
For example, a district in Washington places family liaisons at elementary schools in areas with
growing immigrant and refugee families to match that school’s particular needs.
5) Professional Development–
For cultural events and multilingual signs to make an impact, they need to be backed by faculty
and staff who are continuing to grow professionally in their understanding of cultural
responsiveness, equity, and restoration. Support staff in their professional development related
to mindset, skills, and practices regarding family engagement: for example:
self-assessing one’s own identity and culture within the school context
studying the distinction between behavioral challenges and cultural differences
learning conﬂict resolution skills to address cultural differences 
Let families know about the professional development courses and opportunities that are being
offered to staff. This could be in an email with weekly updates, or on the school website. It is key
to match the engagement plans and decisions to the community. In Georgia, for example, a
district with a growing number of Latino/a families provided professional development
regarding English learning and cultural competency. In addition, the district offered workshopswith community experts regarding instructions and engagement practices to match the needs of
diverse families.
6) Information–
The educational system can be extremely intimidating from the outside looking in. The language
of the educational system, the history of education in the United States, and the power imbalance
between families and staff, faculty, and educators are diffcult for many to navigate. To
counteract this dynamic, avoid using jargon in your conversations or signage. Have family
volunteers, staff, or students offer tours of the school building before a schoolyear starts for new
families or parents and caregivers who are interested. On bulletin boards or website pages,
provide information on school resources, where services are available, courses and enrollment,
etc., in clearly marked links or titles and in multiple languages. 

Even if families were educated within the United States, they most likely were not educated at the
same school as their children. If they were educated at the same school, structures and processes
have most likely changed. Parents cannot support their children in education or engage if they do
not understand the process or mechanisms of education. Resources, focus groups, and school
tours that explain the “what” and “why” of education are important to boost family conﬁdence
in engaging with a school (Hopper, 2020). You want caregivers and parents to be able to advocate
for their children; ensure that they are given the tools to do so.
7) Physical Engagement–
Both parties, families and school staff and faculty, can be skeptical of each other. Bridging that
gap requires intentional engagement. For a start, a “windshield assessment” can be conducted by
staff, like one project conducted by Blitz et al. (2013). Physically driving through the community
and evaluating visible signs of strengths and needs increased educators' familiarity with their
students' background. Community members were engaged through conversations to discuss
their own perceptions of their community and the school. In terms of increasing families’
familiarity with schools, the aforementioned school tours can do this, as can a video tour to share
with families if they’re unable to come physically.
8) Programs & Focus Groups–
The resources offered by schools should match the community's want s or needs. Families can be
brought together to discuss educational barriers they see between themselves and their student,
their needs, and their understanding of where the student stands with the school. This discussion
ought to be facilitated by school counselors or family liaisons while teachers are present. Further,
when preparing a focus group or meeting of any length, take input from families about what days
and duration of time work for them. 

As previously mentioned, removing transportation, food, and childcare barriers is the
infrastructure behind these meetings and focus groups. Marginalized communities have a history
of being let down by institutions or organizations that claim to help them. To establish trust and
respect, break the cycle of offering words instead of action, and ensure that the suggestions,
input, and feedback from families are taken seriously and implemented within schools through
tangible ways.
Here are a few ideas for potentially relevant programs your school can offer in response to the
barriers or needs some marginalized families have outlined: 
a) Financial Aid Night where families can come ﬁll out ﬁnancially related forms, learn about
ﬁnancial literacy, and speak to ﬁnancial advisors or experts. 
b) Parent University where families can have access to learning about their students’
education, preparation for college applications; families and students on committees
(Gulledge, 2021). 
c) Monthly Saturday workshops where relevant topics in the community (e.g., an upcoming
election) or general topics that connect schools and families (e.g., an open forum discussing
how a middle school can better prepare students for the transition to high school).
9)Support Family's Relationship to Their Students–
Many families feel underprepared to support their children with homework, especially as
children get older. Language can be a barrier, as can understanding what educators want from an
assignment. Sending home content-speciﬁc resources, videos, pamphlets, and clear instructions
can mitigate the confusion caused by homework. Further, receiving parents’ feedback on their
ability to help their students with homework can increase participation and encourage
collaboration.These are simply overview examples of equitable and culturally responsive practices that work
to move families that are marginalized into families that are integrated into our schools. You can
most likely think of strategies you or your school are already using that weren't listed here!

Engaging with Families in Rural Areas:
You’ve reviewed a lot of strategies today. You may be, understandably, thinking: "How does this
even work practically? What does it actually look like?" Those questions make sense. The work
we've described is both broad and speciﬁc and can feel like a tall order. As both a motivator that
this work is possible and a practical example of what the work looks like, we're going to go
through strategies used in a research study on family engagement.
This study, conducted by Lisa Blitz and their team in 2013, was chosen for a reason: it focused
on elevating engagement in rural areas, a challenge many school districts (potentially your
own!) face in South Carolina. 
Let's review some facts about rurality in South Carolina.

Information about rural areas in South Carolina
How do educators and school staff care for, connect with, and uplift families and students in
rural communities through family engagement?
The starting point involves self-education.
While poverty is a challenge no matter what geographical area you live in, it is prominent in
South Carolina’s rural areas, as you may have noticed from the graphic. While you are going to
learn more about poverty as a stressor in the lesson on wellness enhancement, for now, we are
going to go through a poverty simulation, SPENT, hosted by Urban Ministries of Durham, a
homeless ministry.

SPENT
Urban Ministries of Durham serves over 6000 people every year who struggle
with poverty and homelessness. Spent is an interactive game created by
McKinney that challenges you to manage your money, raise a child and make it
through the month getting paid minimum wage after a stretch of
unemployment.

We want to acknowledge that you may be familiar with poverty already. You may have lived
through it, come from a family history of it, or seen loved ones struggle. Even if you’ve never
experienced poverty yourself or in your close circles, you probably have a good idea of how
poverty impacts students. We want to validate those experiences! This simulation is simply
another perspective to consider.
As we said earlier, we are walking through this example
as a motivator that everything we've discussed in this
lesson can be done! Let's get into it!
“Prevention through Collaboration: Family Engagement
with Rural Schools Experiencing Poverty" Blitz et. al 2013
The article "Prevention through Collaboration: Family Engagement with Rural Schools and
Families Living in Poverty" emphasizes the importance of collaboration between schools and
families to support children living in poverty in rural areas. The authors suggest several effective
strategies that can be used to support families experiencing poverty.
a) Creating a welcoming and supportive environment: Schools can create a warm and
welcoming atmosphere that makes families feel valued and included. This can be
achieved through initiatives such as parent-teacher conferences, family events, and
other forms of outreach.
b) Building relationships: Schools can encourage parents and
caregivers to build positive relationships with teachers and
other school staff. This can foster trust and open lines of
communication, which can be particularly helpful when
addressing sensitive issues such as academic struggles.
c) Encouraging parent and caregiver involvement: Schools can provide opportunities
for parents to become more involved in their children's education, such as
volunteering in the classroom, attending school events, and joining parent-teacher
associations.
d) Advocating for families: Schools can help families access resources and support
services, such as tutoring, counseling, and healthcare. They can also advocate for
policies and programs that beneﬁt families living in poverty.
e) Providing targeted interventions: Schools can provide targeted interventions that
address the speciﬁc needs of children living in poverty. For example, they can offer
afterschool programs that provide homework help, tutoring, and enrichment
activities.
Overall, the article emphasizes that collaboration and partnership between schools and families
can be a powerful tool for supporting children living in poverty in rural areas. By working
together, schools and families can help to prevent academic struggles, reduce risky behaviors,
and promote positive outcomes for children.
Let's expand on the generalized strategy bullets above by looking
at practical examples for each element. Be sure to congratulate
yourself for the strategies you are already applying!
1) Welcoming and supportive Enviornment: Schools can host family events such as back-to-school nights,
open houses, and community dinners to build relationships with families. Schools can also
implement programs to welcome new families, such as home or community center
visits or personalized welcome packets.
2) Building Relationship: Teachers can reach out to families through phone calls, emails, or in-person meetings to discuss their child's progress or address any concerns. Schools can also establish a family liaison or parent coordinator position to help build connections between families and the school. 
3) Encouraging caregiver involvement: Schools can offer a variety of opportunities for parent involvement, such as parent-teacher conferences, volunteer opportunities, and school decision-making committees. They can also provide resources for families to help support their children's learning at home, such as book lists, reading tips, and educational websites. 
4) Advocating for families: Schools can help families access resources in the community, such as food pantries, healthcare clinics, and job training programs. They can also advocate for policies and programs that benefit families living in poverty, such as increased funding for school behavioral health resources and services or expanded access to pre-K programs. 
5) Targated Interventions: targeted interventions: Schools can offer targeted interventions to address the specific needs of children living in poverty, such as summer learning programs, afterschool tutoring, and mentorship programs. They can also provide resources for families, such as financial literacy classes, parenting workshops, and mental health services.  We will talk more about these targeted interventions in your next course "Reeling in the Supports with Tier 2"
Throughout the case study partnership with rural schools, a
provide resources for families,
number of methods were used by the research team to support
the recommended strategies, including "Parent Leadership
classes parenting workshops
Training Courses (PLTC)". Let's review a few more practical
strategies.
such as ffnancial literacy
a) Parent Leadership Training Course (PLTC) –
The PLTC is a program designed to empower parents to become more involved in their child's
education by providing them with the skills and knowledge needed to be effective advocates for
their children.
b) Financial literacy classes –
Schools can offer ﬁnancial literacy classes to help families better manage their ﬁnances and
navigate economic challenges.
c) Family liaisons or parent coordinators –
Blitz et.al (2013) recommend that schools establish a family liaison or parent coordinator
position to help build connections between families and the school and provide support to families in accessing resources and services.

These practical examples of applying strategies in a rural community is a reminder that you may
be bored of hearing at this point but cannot be overstated: The strategies and tools implemented
to engage families ought to be tailored to the needs of the families in your community. There is
no textbook plan or “sure ﬁre” way to elevate engagement with all families immediately. As
demonstrated by Blitz et al. (2013), elevating family engagement in diffcult to reach groups
takes time, patience, intentionality, and support. And—it is beyond worth it.
Family engagement is family empowerment, as seen in the graduates of the parent leadership
training course. 
"It was the first time any of the parents had graduated from any type
of course or training, and they were bursting with pride."
And this empowerment leads to actual change with real impact. A story told by one of the
mothers in Blitz's study demonstrates this beautifully:

A quote from Blitz et al. (2013)
Up until now, we’ve focused primarily on initiating engagement with families. We’re going to
pivot now to restoring engagement with families when a relationship has been fractured.

Restoring Relationships with Families
Rebuilding Bridges: Strategies for Restoring Relationships with
Families in Education
For the majority of the students in a teacher’s classroom, their relationship to one another is
established and maintained through more straightforward means: a smile at the door with a
greeting, asking about their weekend, and checking-in on them before and after large
assignments. The same goes for most student’s families—educators maintain the relationship
through a quick email, handshakes and hugs on back-to-school nights, and hallway chats
during student performances. For a certain percentage, however, the relationship between
student, family, and teacher needs restoration.
a) These relationships are characterized by “giving up:”
Teachers have given up on engaging with families or the student. For families that
are stigmatized or ostracized, teachers may be pressured to disengage or partake in
discussing the families in a negative light.
b) The student has given up on trying and on feeling heard.
c) Families have given up on a relationship with their student’s teacher or even with
the student themselves.
How do we overcome the frustration and stigma to get these families
and their student the help they need?
The answer comes in restorative practices.
While many schools are trained in restorative practices, the training can vary signiﬁcantly.
When we say, “restorative practices,” we are referring to a broader version than you may be
familiar with. 
Restorative practices are the strategies used to repair relationships between everyone in the
school setting—between teachers, staff, students, families, and faculty.
While this may include juvenile justice, it expands beyond those involved in the criminal justice
system to everyone connected to your school, including families. You, understandably, might be
thinking:
If a family simply doesn’t want to engage, or has been hurt by a school and no
longer wants to be near a school representative, how in the worldam I going to get
them involved in restorative practices?
We hear you. This is hard work, and results don’t come immediately. Remind yourself that you
are not responsible for the actions of another; you cannot make a family do or stop something.
All you can do is your best, what you’re asked to do.
Let's review some practical strategies you can use.

Restoration Strategies
Practically restoring relationships takes time, patience, and humility. There are a variety of
frameworks used for restorative practices, such as the Five R’s of Restorative Justice:
-relationship
-respect
-responsibility
-repair
-reintegration
See the attached article from the Conffict Center that
gives a deeper analysis of the Five R’s!
The 5 R's of Restorative Justice - Conffict Center
A great way to understand the Restorative Justice Community Group Conference
process is to look at it through the lens of the 5 R's: Relationship, Respect,
Responsibility, Repair, and Reintegration (credited to Beverly Title, founder of
Resolutionaries). Read the restorative practices overview or skip to the 5 R's

Establish-Maintain-Restore
A framework developed speciﬁcally for schools is the Establish-Maintain-Restore framework,
also known as the Equity Explicit Establish-Maintain-Restore (EE-EMR) framework. While
originally designed for student-educator relationships (Cook et al., 2018; Gaias et al., 2020), the
Equity Explicit Establish-Main-Restore (EE-EMR) framework provides extremely helpful
guidelines for restoring family-educator relationships.
You are going to brieﬂy look at practical strategies to establish, maintain, and restore
relationships between families and educators. You will go much more in depth on Establish-
Maintain-Restore in the lesson on school climate!

Like we said earlier, we know this is hard work. Here are
a few more resources to help support your efforts! They
cover restorative practices, as well as Conffict

As you push through the challenge, remind yourself that your progress can be exponential.
Families talk to one another. Making inroads with one caregiver can very well inﬂuence the
families in that caregiver’s social circle as they share their experiences with one another.
By focusing on families that may be challenging to engage because of their speciﬁc, intensive
needs, we prepare a foundation for better staff, family, student and school climate outcomes! As
you work through the next lesson on school climate and safety, think through the role of family
engagement in improving them.
You have spent a lot of time reviewing strategies to elevate or restore family engagement. Let’s
work through a scenario together before moving into the summary!

IMAGE HERE First day of school case study
IMAGE HERE Jaden's Story


Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
1) Leadership support in family engagement is crucial; leadership can elevate family
engagement by setting aside resources (e.g., money, time, space), creating
opportunities for family engagement (e.g., calendar dates for events, professional
development), and explicitly including family engagement as a core value in their
mission statement or vision.
2) There are a multitude of barriers between schools and families that hinder
engagement. Some of the ones were: transportation diffculties, scheduling,
distrust of school systems, non-English speaking as a ﬁrst language, and having
children in different grades across different schools.
3) Certain families struggle with family engagement more than
others. You learned about engaging with families on the
outskirts, using many of the strategies that were previously
discussed but with a different mindset.
4) Restoring relationships through the EE-EMR framework involves the same
humility and patience needed to engage with all families, just in a different setting.

Elevating Family Engagement
From Theory to Action in Elevating Family Engagement
As you continue to explore the realm of family engagement, we, the SBHA, build upon the
foundational understanding established in the previous lesson, Elevating Family and Student
Engagement. In the prior lesson, you learned about the critical role of leadership support in
driving strategies to enhance outcomes for staff, families, and students. You also gained an
understanding of the importance of honing our ability to engage with historically marginalized
or less-involved families and students, along with learning the art of reestablishing
relationships with families. With this essential groundwork part in place, you will now shift
from theoretical foundations to practical implementation. In this lesson, the focus turns to
family engagement within our state, South Carolina. You will closely examine the state’s Family
Engagement K–12 Framework and its strategies that serve as the foundation for effective family
engagement plans. Through exploring these practical approaches, the aim is to bridge theory
with action, equipping you with actionable insights to elevate family engagement in ways that
truly matter.
Before starting this lesson, a gentle reminder that family engagement, in all of its diffculties
and intricacies, is one of the most worthwhile efforts we can make as educators and change-
makers in our school systems. 
Let this following quote from the National Parent Teacher Association Standards for
Parent/Family Involvement (2010, p.17) be a reminder as you continue on this lesson.
"Effectively engaging parents and families in the education of their
children has the potential to be far more transformational than any other
type of education reform.” 
National Parent Teacher Association Standards for Parent/Family Involvement

Family Engagement in South Carolina
South Carolina Family Engagement K–12 Framework
As you may recall from Core MTSS Practices, there is legislation in place to support family
engagement —Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities in
Education Act (IDEA). 
In addition, South Carolina has speciﬁc legislation that aims to support family and school
engagement. Examples are the SC Code of Laws Title 59, Chapter 28; the South Carolina School
Improvement Council, and the South Carolina Annual Parent Survey. 
See the attached PDFs below for more information.
Every Student Succeeds Act.pdf
Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act.pdf
Family Engagement Supports and Resources- South Carolina.pdf

South Carolina K–12 Framework
One of those supports is the South Carolina Family Engagement K–12 Framework (SC K–12
Framework; 2019). This was developed in line with the Title 59 mandate with help from the
Council of Chief State School Offcers. The purpose of the Framework is to provide action steps
and strategies to ground family engagement policies and practices at each level: state, district,
and school.
There are ﬁve strategies in the SC K-12 Framework that are the anchors for practical family
engagement plans. Let’s brieﬂy look at those now. We will get more in-depth later on!
Think of these as the instruction manuals behind each tool or practical strategy we will use to
build our Tier 1 supports.
Building Relationships –
Mutual trust and respect between schools and families; valuing the diversity of each other; the
ability to communicate clearly and listen actively and share information on students’ academics,
behavior, and positive health and wellbeing.
Communication –
Effectively conveying and understanding information between schools and advocates; two-way
communication that uses multiple strategies to build relationships between schools and families.
Linking Learning Outcomes –
Keeping families knowledgeable about what their students are learning and about their role in
supporting students in achieving goals; providing strong school supports for family engagement
and ensuring that families are aware of them. 
Collaborative Practices –
Staff and families learning with and from each other; viewing each individual through an assets-
based lens; working together and sharing information to achieve outcomes not achievable in
isolation.
Community Partnerships –
Mutual commitments with community organizations (businesses, recreational centers, faith-
based organizations, volunteer groups, healthcare organizations, higher education) that engage
families in ways that are relevant and suitable for everyone involved.
These are the ﬁve overarching strategies that practical steps for elevating family engagement
will fall under. You learned the beneﬁts of family engagement for students, and you’ve already
seen the theories, such as dual capacity building theory, behind this in Core MTSS. We now have
these strategies to guide our thinking and planning.
Moving from theory and ideals to a systematic, intentional integration of families with a
collaborative partnership requires practical strategy and ideas. That is what we are going to
cover next!

Elevating Family Engagement in Practical Ways
Practical Strategies for Building Relationships
You will notice an overlap between practical plans under each strategy; this is due to the
interlocking nature of these strategies! After all, you can’t build relationships without
communication—and building relationships is where we start!
Before you review practical strategies to elevate family engagement, we want to acknowledge
the work that you are already doing. It can feel, at times, overwhelming or even insulting to
suggest adding on activities that are completed outside of work hours or are simply another
"thing" tacked on to an already over-full plate. 
We hear you! These strategies are not meant to say, "You're not doing enough" or "Add this on
top of everything". These are practical tools you can choose to use in line with the MTSS
framework. 
As you review these tools, know that it might take scheduling creatively, meeting with your
grade-level team, or reaching out to your social worker, school counselor, or School Behavioral
Health Academy coach. You are NOT alone, and we are here for you! 

Building Relationships
Relationships are built as much on tiny, day-to-day interactions as they are on set-aside,
planned events, and meetings. Strategies to build relationships require both! Let’s look at the
day-to-day moments ﬁrst. This includes both body language and verbal affrmation. While
these strategies may seem mundane or even obvious, they are important because we experience
them in every relationship.
Day-to-Day –
-Smile when you see parents and caregivers.
-Learn parents' and caregivers' names! Use this opportunity to connect with students. Ask
them what their parents prefer to be called or what most people call their parents— by their
ﬁrst name? Last? If their name is associated with a title, such as Dr. or Reverend, do they
prefer that? It is best to assume formality until the family advises otherwise.
-Smile at the student while talking to their caregivers so that the child knows that they are
included and valued in the conversation.
-Celebrate parents and caregivers. Thank them for what they do. This can be in a day-to-day
interaction verbally when they’re picking their student up or dropping them off, or more
intentionally, such as in a section printed in the school newspaper or an email.

Intentional ways to build relationships aren't just meetings, formal or informal. This is where
communication overlaps: intentional ways of building relationships include what you say and
how. You'll see examples of settings, statements, and more in the next section!
Intentional Settings –
1) During one of your ﬁrst meetings, declare your intentions to the caregiver or parent. For
example, say, "I want to partner with you," or "I look forward to working alongside you,"
and so forth. Use language that communicates an equal partnership and collaboration
between you and the family for the student. 
2) If the family speaks another language as their primary language, ﬁnd an interpreter or staff
member who is bilingual. 
3) Ask questions about the student outside of school, such as what their favorite activity is, or
who other important people are in their lives. You’re showing the family that you care about
their student beyond what occurs within school walls. 
4) Explain the rationale behind what you’re doing. Remember, we don't know what we don't
know. Instead of referencing what you’re doing with educational system jargon or
acronyms, explain what you're doing and why you're doing it using references to their
speciﬁc student.
5) Share every success. Let families know how their students are doing and what they’re doing
well in, academically, behaviorally, and in their positive health and wellbeing. 
6) Give parents opportunities to volunteer in class and in school. Schools have open-door
policies where families can come observe their child’s class; make sure parents know about
this! You can use online calendars where weekly or monthly slots are available for meeting
with the teacher, visiting school, etc. 
7) Hold parent meetings early in the school year, within the ﬁrst month if possible. Use an
online signup sheet so families can ﬁnd a time that works for their schedules. During these
meetings, focus on personal connections such as shared backgrounds, hobbies, and hopes
for the student. Explain plans for communication and ask for family communication
preferences and expectations. 
You are now going to zoom in on one intentional setting in particular: home visits.
While schools may not frequently engage in home visits as a common practice, it's
important to be mindful that the concept of home visits is a valuable approach to family
engagement. Despite its limited prevalence, understanding the potential beneffts and
strategies linked with home visits can broaden your perspective on fostering stronger
connections between educators and families.

Home Visits
You are going to walk through two different scenarios of how home visits can go. Let's start
with Elizabeth, a 3rd grade teacher, meeting Elena, the mother of her student Yasmine.
 Start of Scenario
Home Visits: Friend or Foe?
Elizabeth has never met Yasmine's mom before. She's in the
apartment complex parking lot getting ready to walk to the
apartment. Let's drop in on Elizabeth and Elena as they get ready.
It's 5:45 PM. School got out a couple hours ago, but I stayed late
to grade so that I wouldn't be too far behind because of this visit.
Meeting these home visit quotas is hard!
My administrator just assumes I know what I'm doing, but I
don't. And all this gas is expensive. Even though I've asked my
colleagues about what to say, I still feel unsure of what to do.
I should probably bring my tote with the resources, pamphlets,
and notes I brought just in case Yasmine's parents have
questions. This is for them, after all, and I hope it helps them
trust us more.
I'll try to make this quick. I don't want to be here, and I am sure
they don't want me here either. They won't mind if we're a bit
brief.
I got back from work 15 minutes ago, and I'm supposed to have
these two teachers in my home? I've barely had time to
straighten up, much less get ready or fix food. I wish we met in
the park.
I feel like a bad hostess. I don't want them to judge me. I saw two
of them get out of the car; do they think they're unsafe here? And
why do they have so much stuff — are they taking notes on this?
Are they going to report on how my house is, what Yasmine's
room looks like? We usually eat dinner at 6:15; what if Yasmine
starts fussing and they think I'm a bad mom?
I feel intimidated and worried. I hope it's fast, but I hope they're
nice and empathetic. I don't know. I've never done this before.
 End of Scenario
You can probably imagine how the rest of that visit went. Both Elizabeth and Elena were
stressed, tired, and didn't know what to expect. They felt unprepared and seemed unsure of the visit's purpose.

Let's now meet Christian, a teacher from the local middle school, visiting Jerome's home to
meet his caregiver, Liam.
Start of Scenario
Home Visits: Friend or Foe?
Christian is on his way to meet Liam and George, the parents of
his student Jerome. Let's see how Christian and George are
getting ready for the visit.
It's 5:45 PM; even though this is later than I usually work, I am
really grateful that my principal made these visits voluntary and
paid for gas. I'm also grateful for the paid training on Saturday.
I wouldn't have thought that they might be concerned that I'm
evaluating their home, or that I have an issue with Jerome. I'm
glad I got the chance to explain in those emails and phone call!
I'll leave the folders in the car just to make it clear that I'm only
here to get to know them better! Jerome told me they usually eat
at 6:30, so I'll leave before then so they have time as a family.
While I am unsure of how this will actually go, I really appreciate
how Christian clarified what the purpose of this visit is and that
we, with Jerome, got to decide if we wanted to do this.
Liam, my partner, and I have really wanted to engage more with
Jerome's new middle school, but we've been really busy with new
jobs and we don't feel super comfortable in school buildings.
Meeting here feels more comfortable for Liam and me, and I
really value that flexibility. Since I know exactly who is coming
and why, I feel less stressed than I did when I first heard about it.
I'm excited for Christian to get to know us better, and for us to
get to know Jerome's teachers. I think this could be the start of an
awesome relationship with the school.
 End of Scenario
Christian's visit to Liam and George was distinctly
different from Elizabeth and Miller's visit to Elena and Marcus.
Why?Was Christian just a better teacher, or
Liam and George "better" parents? As you examine
home visits, you will answer those questions!

Challenges of Home Visits
As you saw with Christian, home visits give educators a way to build relationships with families
outside school and gain insight into family dynamics, culture, and relationships. Research
reveals the value of home visits in improving family-educator relationships (Soule & Curtis,
2021; Stetson et al., 2012), beneﬁtting student outcomes (Sheldon & Jung, 2018; Soule & Curtis,
2021; Wright et al., 2018), and removing certain barriers (e.g., intimidation of school grounds,
transportation issues, childcare; Gulledge, 2021; Hopper, 2020; Jacques & Villegas, 2018).
However, home visits can also be intimidating to families or frightening. This was clear with
Elizabeth and Elena! Educators coming into the home may give families a fear similar to a child
welfare visit or a housing inspection. Having educators or staff visit a family’s most personal
space can feel intrusive, or stressful as social norms dictate a level of hospitality that adds extra
work to a family’s plate. Further, the way educators or staff react in a home setting (e.g.,
nervous, defensive, overly comfortable) can be insulting or off-putting to families. On the
educator side, suggesting that educators add another task that is so time-consuming and
intensive can feel detached from the reality of what teachers are already doing. 
Review these following guidelines to learn more about
conducting family visits, regardless of where they
happen!

Standards for conducting home visits and reminders
"The goal of home visits is to learn from families, not teach
families."
Paulick et al. (2023)
Before moving into communication, let's listen to Marcus Jackson, an executive consultant for
the San Diego County Offce of Education, as he discusses building relationships with families,
provides practical steps, and outlines his own strategy for engaging families, regardless of the
setting!
Marcus beautifully describes the "triangular process" between schools, communities, and
families while giving practical strategies to implement for family engagement. While Marcus
brieﬂy touches on working with diffcult relationships between schools and families, you will
dive into that more thoroughly toward the end of the lesson!

Elevating Family Engagement in Practical Ways
Practical Strategies for Communication
You’ve most likely noticed the threads of the next key strategy communication already. Let’s
dive deeper into practical ways you can communicate with families to elevate their engagement!
Any house built by a team that cannot communicate with each other is a house destined to fall.
Communication is key for relationships, effectiveness, and simply getting it
done.
The issue with communication between families and schools is not that it cannot happen, but
how it happens.
- Does it provide families with opportunities to share their feedback and
actively participate in the conversation?
- Is it peppered inconsistently throughout weeks and happening only
when a need arises?
- Or is it radio silence for the most part?
This is what Marcus Jackson meant when he talked about talking with parents instead of at
them. Here are key strategies you can use to communicate more effectively with families!
1) Communicate often and in various forms: Consistent, dependable communication is the bedrock of two-way communication. Multiple methods of communication are needed: families value forms such as newsletters, texting, emails, and in-person communication. Communication can occur in groups (e.g., focus groups, parent-teacher conferences, etc.) or individually (e.g., phone calls, home visits, emails).  
2) Make a positive home phone call: Positive home phone calls early or towards the middle of the school year are your opportunity to learn more about the student and their family. It’s important to ensure that your first communication with a family is not over a negative issue, whether a low grade or a behavioral complication. These calls also allow you to share with caregivers your own positive experiences with the student. If you have a smaller classroom, you may be able to make phone calls to every student’s family. If that is not feasible, you can make positive phone calls to families of students who seem to be struggling, are new, or are receiving Tier 2 or Tier 3 supports. 
3) Have a translator: Have a translator: According to the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, 7.3% of South Carolinian families speak a language other than English in the home. While that may seem like a small percentage, that’s over 300,000 people! Families that speak a language other than English deserve to be known and seen in ways that work for them. Families who speak languages other than English deserve to be respected and understood. The availability of bilingual staff and translators demonstrates a commitment to an inclusive and welcoming school environment.
4) Use Inclusive language: It is easy to slip into assumptions about family structure or what we expect a student’s family to be like. Yet, we know that many families are not a “typical nuclear” family. Caregivers may be biological or adoptive, married or single, homosexual or heterosexual — and any combination of this! Students may be in foster care, living with grandparents, or have a single parent. Ask open-ended questions to your students about their families to get a better understanding.  

Outside of speciﬁc plans like having a translator or using inclusive language, much of
communication comes down to simply being a conversationalist. Watch Celeste Headlee, a
journalist and radio show-host, go over ten ways to have a better conversation during a 2016
TED Talk in Savannah, Georgia.
Celeste Headlee: 10 ways to have a better conversation | TED
You just listened to Celeste Headlee offering invaluable insights into the art of conversation. Her
practical tips and thoughtful advice serve as a guide to enhancing our everyday interactions.
These principles help you cultivate more meaningful connections, foster understanding, and
bridge divides in a world where effective communication is more crucial than ever.
Celeste Headlee's tips are great for in-person communication, and some of them apply to
communicating through technology. Given how ubiquitous technology is, you are going to
dedicate more time to examining communication through technology with families.

Communicating Through Technology
While not accessible to or preferable for every family, technology-based communication is a
staple in many schools and provides a level of effectiveness and ease for communicating.
Technology can be used to contact parents at a time when they’re accessible but not on school
grounds and can be used in a variety of methods: short emails, newsletters, website updates,
texts, calls, and more. At the beginning of the school year, consider creating and sharing a brief,
informal online survey where families can share a bit about themselves as well as select their
preferred method of communication and speciﬁc times of day they’re available! 
Research shows that caregivers are especially interested in technology-based communication
that allows them to respond or give feedback instead of simply reading what the educator has to
say (Ketly & Waydashi, 2022). This further creates a feeling of equitable partnership. There are a
few apps and processes used for communication in schools that you may be familiar with
already. Let’s brieﬂy look at those now to boost your communication with families online!
1) REMIND APP:This is an app for educators to text students and families with reminders, motivational messages,
and homework updates. It allows the educator to set offce hours so parents can connect with the
educator and discuss what’s on their mind. This is a two-way app; families can send the educator
voice notes and permission slips as well! 
2) CLASROOM WEBSITE: Educators can put every resource required for their classroom in one place for families and
students to easily access; here, educators can post class updates, photos, and reminders. A
classroom website weeds out the overwhelming number of emails with attachments being sent.
There are multiple different website building tools:
-Wix
-WordPress
-HubSpot Drag-and-Drop Website Builder
-Mozello
-Weebly
These are free, and there are plenty of others that you can pay to get help setting up a website! If
you have a high school classroom, creating or editing a classroom website can be an assignment!
3) BLOOMZ APP: Bloomz is a hybrid between a messaging app and a classroom website! Parents connect to the
educator as well as to other parents. Class updates allow for video and photo sharing, and the
calendar has itemized events that link to other pages. Educators can send messages about student
timelines and behavior, and the app has more of a social networking feel because parents can like
and respond to statuses. 
4) SLIDESHOW: This is a strategy that works best with families of younger students. With the families’ permission,
you can take pictures during class and create little slideshows to send to parents throughout the
year to see what their students are learning and doing! Parents can also make one for educators to
show the student’s life outside of school. 
Given that the majority of family and school communication comes from schools to families, it
is important to respond promptly to communication from families. Whether your own
availability is outlined in the class's syllabus, or communicated one-on-one, dedicate time in
your schedule to respond to families. One principal set up a system with his secretary where he
would respond to every phone call from a parent by the end of the day (Leo et al., 2019). When
parents ﬁrst call, the secretary would inform them that the principal would call them back after
3 PM. Plans like these increase trust between families and schools when they are followed
through with consistency!
As you move forward into the next strategy, keep this following quote in mind when you reﬂect
on communication!
“The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used
interchangeably, but they signify quite different things:
Information is giving out; communication is getting through.”
- Sydney J. Harris, American Journalist

Elevating Family Engagement in Practical Ways
Practical Strategies for Linking Families to Learning Outcomes
Families need to know their role in their student’s success. Bringing families into the
educational process and academic career of their students takes time. In many ways, the
process of including families is less deﬁned than strategies to build relationships or
communicate because learning outcomes are so diverse.
Let’s listen to Dr. Karen Mapp, the creator of the Dual Capacity Building Framework for Family-
School Partnerships that you may have learned about already if you took the Core MTSS
Practices. In this clip, Dr. Mapp gives a talk at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on the
purpose of linking families to learning.
VIDEO HERE
Dr. Mapp clearly laid out the value of linking families to learning outcomes. And, as you already
know, you’ll encounter students with different learning outcomes in the same class, and
families with their own expectations and desires for a student that may or may not align with
yours! You'll likely encounter more parents than not who don’t know how to engage with their
student’s learning outcomes.
Use the following tips to link families to their student's
learning outcomes!
Tip 1: Let Parents Know How They Can Help
Tell parents about volunteering opportunities or let them know they can observe their
child’s class at any time! Give speciﬁc feedback to parents on how they can help their
students. This includes offering parents course-speciﬁc content, educational videos, and
other resources they can use to brush up on a topic they may not have touched on in years. 
Tip 2: Be Specific
VIDEO HERE
This is a video of an academic parent-teacher team meeting, a model for family engagement
created by Maria C. Paredes, where the ﬁrst-grade teacher provides speciﬁc tools families
can use to help their students at home with homework.
Here are more speciﬁc examples. “You can help Colby with his math homework by asking
him to explain how he reached his solution," or "You can help Jessica with her English
homework by having her read aloud what she’s written!”
Speciﬁc instructions are helpful for families of young students and older students alike.
Families may not able to explain sounding out consonants, the War of 1812, or algebraic
division without a refresher themselves. Through the parent’s preferred method of
communication, include an, "Ask Me About..." In this section, you can describe a few of the
topics being covered in class, especially topics students may ﬁnd challenging. This will equip
families to support continued learning outside the school. Include real-world connections,
like connecting the value of learning history to the present and practical usages of math in
day-to-day life.
Tip 3: Receive Feedback from Families on Homework
For younger students, having a parent helping them with homework is beneﬁcial if the
parents are positive about engaging with the material. Parents are more likely to be positive if
the work is not extremely long or taxing (Bachman et al., 2021). While you are the expert as a
teacher, families are able to provide valuable feedback on how the material is being processed
and understood by their children. By seeking feedback on assignments, you communicate to
families that you value their engagement with the material. After all, they cannot give input
on an assignment if they have not engaged with it in the ﬁrst place. 
Tip 4: Actively Work to Remove Obstacles that Prevent Families from Engaging
Families want to join their students. However, there are signiﬁcant barriers that prevent
families from coming to school. Events typically occur during evenings, when families would
be returning from or going to work, feeding children, or watching younger and older
children. Remove barriers by offering food and drinks to families at events and ensuring that
food is available for people with certain diet restrictions. Many families have more than one
child; arrange childcare by having educators available to supervise play or host students at
the same time as family workshops or meetings. Travel can be expensive— offer gas gift
cards! 
Ultimately, you cannot fully connect each family to their student’s learning outcomes on your
own. You also can’t be an expert on everything, and you shouldn’t be!
What you need to be is a broker of resources. Have resources ready when parents come to you
for help regarding their student—tutors, school counselors, other staff who may be more
qualiﬁed, programs, and even other families. Here are a few you can use! We've provided South
Carolina's K-12 Framework and the South Carolina Proﬁle of a Graduate.

Elevating Family Engagement in Practical Ways
Practical Strategies for Collaborative Practices
Vanilla Ice may have said it best, "Collaborate and Listen!"
Collaboration is active engagement with one another, built on trust, open communication, and
mutual respect. It involves shared responsibility for student outcomes and active participation
by both families and schools in meeting those outcomes. Griffths et al. (2021) deﬁnes shared
responsibility and active participation in the educational context as:
- Shared Responsibility: each member contributes their own expertise and has a
unique role in determining solutions and strategies. In shared responsibility,
ownership is collective, roles are clear, and responsibilities are outlined.
- Active Participation: Each member takes responsibility for their role and contributes
resources. 
Together, shared responsibility and active participation create shared decision-making: teams
systematically take input from all members before making a decision.
School leaders support initiatives to bring families, faculty, and staff together so they can learn
from each other. Both families and schools are viewed through an asset-based lens: What do
you bring to the table? What does that caregiver bring to the table? When both parties are viewed
through an asset-based lens, the "I tell, you do" moves towards “we” statements. 
Let’s look at four examples of schools that collaborated with families to elevate family
engagement. 
Principal Zavala –
On a Saturday, Principal Zavala, the principal of a primarily immigrant, Latino/a and low-
achieving school, hosted a school-sponsored event for families. Caregivers brought their children
to school where educators watched them through supervised sports or playing. While the
children were supervised, caregivers picked two out of ﬁfteen workshops on strengthening
family dynamics and ﬁnancial growth. The intentionality of the event was seen in the bilingual or
Spanish-speaking educators and staff who greeted the caregivers, and the food provided, pan
dulce (sweet rolls), was culturally signiﬁcant.
Principal Zavala wanted to elevate family engagement in ways that were more than just
checking-off boxes but were important to the families and relevant to the community. Outside of
the Saturday workshops, Principal Zavala and the educators, faculty, and staff met and reached
out to other organizations and programs in the community that would beneﬁt their families,
such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund or Lea Conmigo (Read With
Me). 
Principal Perez –
Principal Perez is an elementary school principal in a working-class neighborhood. The school's
resources were used to support a family engagement program called Parents as Authors where
school parents write a book about their family to share with their students. The program ran over
several months. Workshops staffed by educators included brainstorming ideas, sentence-
starters, editing, and ultimately, presenting their stories to their children. The value of this
approach was that it connected not just the families to the school and vice versa but families to
other families within the community. Principal Perez said that learning about families'
backgrounds, their experiences with education, and their hope for their students gave school
staff and educators a deeper understanding and empowered them to more strongly connect with
the families.
Principal Franco –
Principal Franco, or “Principal Learner,” as the sign on his door said, set up monthly Saturday
workshops at the school in addition to an annual parent conference. At the workshops, open-
ended questions served as the topics. For example, one topic was: "Why education is important to
me." Caregivers and staff alike share their experiences and thoughts in a guided discussion. These
meetings were important because they took a school and family connection that is typically
fragmented and turned into a "village." Aside from these workshops, Principal Franco moved
traditional “home visits” into a classroom with a group of parents to ease the stress families may
feel having educators in the home. The hope with these visits was that it would do more for
parental engagement than the traditional PTA meetings that had not succeeded in the past. 
Assistant Principal Young –
Assistant Principal Young knew that families in the community were suspicious of schools due to
previous discrimination and mistrust. Home visits were organized to meet the families where
they were. Visits took place over months and were on a voluntary basis. These visits were focused
on getting to know families and were strictly positive. As the Assistant Principal noted, engaging
with families requires leadership involvement or the efforts will fade out. Assistant Principal
Young saw a “snowball” effect with the families and staff involved in home visits; they were more
likely to engage in other activities, such as the Homework Club! The root of desiring and
structuring family engagement was based on Assistant Principal Young’s ﬁrm belief that families
are natural partners in a collective responsibility for children.

Implementing Collaborative Family Engagement Initiatives in Your School
The examples provided above offer valuable insights into effective strategies for collaborating
with families to enhance family engagement in schools. Indeed, you can use these examples to
implement similar initiatives in your own school. Here are a few key steps.
- Start by adopting an asset-based approach, recognizing the strengths families and
schools bring to the table.
- Host inclusive events that cater to your community's needs, fostering open
communication and mutual understanding.
- Utilize resources creatively, involving families in projects like the "Parents as
Authors" initiative to deepen connections.
- Offer diverse points of engagement such as workshops and meetings, addressing
potential barriers with solutions like childcare and transportation assistance.
- Engage school leaders and educators, creating a shared sense of responsibility.
- Leverage community resources to expand support networks, and prioritize building
trust and positive relationships.
By adapting these strategies to your particular context, you can establish collaborative practices
that enhance student success through meaningful family engagement.

Practical Strategies for Community Partnerships
Effective Approaches for Building School and Community
Connections
A key value of community partnerships is that they extend learning activities outside of the
school walls. Schools can network with community organizations, faith-based institutions,
businesses, libraries, or tutoring programs. Working with and within communities also moves
what can be an intimidating school environment to a more neutral or positive one. Let’s brieﬂy
look at the different strategies used for starting community partnerships.

Beginning a New Community Partnership: When identifying community organizations as possible school partners, a helpful place to
start is looking at the organization's values. You want the community partnerships to reﬂect
the values of the school and its families; values that establish and maintain continuity for
school staff, families, and students. 
You’ll cover expectations and values later in this course, but for now, look at the following
two examples of organizations you may consider for partnership: Coca-Cola® and Chick-
ﬁl-A®. The values of Coca-Cola® include leadership, collaboration, integrity, accountability,
passion, diversity, and quality. The values of Chick-ﬁl-A® are, "We're here to serve, we're
better together, we are purpose driven, and we pursue what's next."
Informal Beginnings: As simple as it sounds, community partnerships can start with an email or a phone call. If
you want to partner with a local restaurant, food bank, or faith-based institution, you can
most likely ﬁnd a contact person on their website with a phone number or email. Leverage
the connections you already have within your school. Ask: “What restaurants do you
frequent? Are there charity organizations where you volunteer?” If your school has a social
worker, given the nature of their job, they may know organizations to consider as partners. A
simple greeting and inquiry about openness to partnerships, or a conversation the next time
you stop by, can be the starting point for future collaboration between school and
community organizations and their leaders.
Formal Beginnings: If you don't have a relationship with an organization and want to reach out, try sending or
emailing a letter. Check out the templates below as an example (Riffel, 2016).
Here are the templates by Riffel (2016) combined in a
PDF. This resource includes letter templates and
example activities.
Community Involvement In Positive Behavior Support.pdf
337.6 KB
The second letter template (page 5) from Dr. Riffel is a perfect bridge to maintaining community
relationships. Maintaining community partnerships often looks like repeating events annually
(e.g., Christmas Toy Drives every December), systematic student/teacher discounts from
schools in a district at a local chain, or an after-school program held at faith-based or
recreational centers around the school. The theme in all of these is consistency and time.
Often, school psychologists and/or social workers in your schools will have examples of
maintained school-community partnerships or know of community organizations to join.
Given how these groups may move around within a district, have them create an Excel
spreadsheet with the contact information for community partners, both established and ones
hoped for, that your school can hold onto even if the school psychologist or counselor leaves! 
The template below is a spreadsheet to use when
beginning your outreach to community partners.
Community Partnership Template.xlsx
8.6 KB
Overall, community partnerships offer a valuable avenue for extending learning experiences
beyond the school building. Collaborating with community organizations, faith-based
institutions, businesses, libraries, and other entities not only enriches educational
opportunities but also contributes to creating a more welcoming and positive learning
environment. Through aligning with shared values, schools can establish partnerships that
resonate with their staff, families, and students, fostering continuity and mutual
understanding. Initiating community partnerships can take various forms, ranging from
informal connections through emails or phone calls to more formal approaches such as
sending introductory letters. Leveraging existing relationships, school personnel, such as
social workers, can play a pivotal role in identifying potential partners and initiating
conversations. These partnerships can then evolve into sustained relationships, marked by
consistent events and interactions that beneﬁt both schools and the broader community.
Through careful maintenance and organization of contact information, schools can ensure the
longevity of these valuable connections and continue to reap the beneﬁts of collaborative
community engagement.

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- South Carolina K-12 Framework provides ﬁve guiding strategies to structure family
engagement efforts around building relationships, communication, linking families
to learning outcomes, collaborative practices, and community partnerships. 
- Relationships develop from both daily interactions and planned events. Effective
relationship-building involves a combination of these aspects, beginning with
everyday moments that include body language and verbal affrmation. Despite their
apparent simplicity, these strategies hold signiﬁcance due to their universal
presence in all relationships.
- Effective communication with families can be in various forms communication
including positive home phone calls, inclusive language, and technology-based
communication.
-Involving families in their student's education is indeed essential. Conveying
speciﬁc ways parents can help, offering feedback channels on homework,
overcoming engagement obstacles, and acting as a resource broker are all practical
tips to strengthen family-school partnerships.
- Collaboration is a foundation for effective family engagement, detailing shared
responsibility, active participation, and shared decision-making.
- Community partnerships extend beyond the school building through collaborations
with diverse organizations, aligning shared values, and fostering a positive
environment. These relationships evolve into sustained interactions, beneﬁting
education and the community, with organized contact information ensuring
ongoing engagement.

What is School Climate?
The Pattern of how a School Functions and Feels
Image of a tree: side with lush leaves and green grass vs. side with a leaﬂess tree in
the desert sun
What are some ideas that come to mind when you hear the word climate? You might think of the
weather outside, and whether it’s hot or cold, sunny or rainy, calm or stormy. Whatever the
weather is, it can make a signiﬁcant difference in how you feel. You might need sunscreen or an
umbrella, a jacket or short sleeves, or you may not want to go outside at all. A climate is the
long-term representation of weather patterns, where individual days may display short-term
weather variations, but the overall climate reﬂects the typical conditions over an extended
period of time.
School climate is an overarching concept that describes the character and quality of a school.
The climate of a school signiﬁcantly impacts the experience of anyone entering the building,
either positively or negatively.
School climate includes the norms, attitudes, and beliefs of the school community, the way that
people are treated and treat others, the feeling within and surrounding the school, and the way
the school is perceived.  Like with the weather outside, each day may vary, but climate describes
a school's patterns over time and in general.

The Key Elements Contributing to School Climate
According to the Safe and Supportive Schools Model, school climate is the synthesis of three
factors:
- environment
- engagement
- safety
As demonstrated in the image, each of these elements overlaps to create an atmosphere that
profoundly inﬂuences academic achievement, behavioral choices, and the overall learning
experience.
Let’s explore each one.  
IMAGE HERE
A Venn Diagram of the three components of school climate

Environment
The environment is the broader context and circumstances in which learning takes place in a
school. The environment includes more than just the physical surroundings and has many
components. Flip through the ﬂashcards below to learn more details about what makes up a
school's environment.
Phyiscial Envioronment: The school building is the physical
environment, including the quality and functioning of the facilities,
level of cleanliness, ambiance, and how the school is furnished and
decorated.
Instructional Environment: The classroom environment includes the quality and rigor of
instruction, teacher attitudes, academic support, and the use of
evidence-based practices in the classroom.  
Physical Health: This refers to the amount that the environment contributes to
physical health. This contribution could be through encouraging and
educating students about nutrition, providing access to health
education, and providing access to sports, recess, and physical education.
Mental Health: This refers to how the environment supports mental health. The level of
awareness, stigma, and mental health literacy (MHL) programming
that schools support can all contribute to an environment that
promotes positive mental health.
Discipline:   This refers to the expectations and behavior management practices in
the school. Effective, positive behavior management strategies can contribute to a positive school
climate where students respect each other and follow school expectations. 

Engagement
Engagement within a school community refers to the level of participation and collaboration of
all school stakeholders, including educators, students, and the broader community. High levels
of engagement indicate that school community members feel comfortable, accepted, and valued
in the community. Building engagement involves the following: 
Cultural & Linguistic Comeptence: All backgrounds and identities are respected and valued. School staff are aware of their own identities and can relate to others from various backgrounds. If you have taken the Core MTSS course you know all about cultural and linguistic competence! If you haven't, go check out that course where there's a whole lesson dedicated to it! 
Relationship: Relationships between students, educators, and the community are nurtured. Positive relationships increase feelings of school connectedness and enable stronger academic progress for students. This greater connectedness increases the likelihood that families and communities will be involved.
School Participation: School participation includes how often and in what capacity community members participate. For students, this might look like attendance and participation in the classroom. For families and community members, this might look like attending school events, serving on leadership teams, volunteering, and other activities.   


Safety
School safety is essential to a positive school climate. School safety is about creating an
environment where students, teachers, and school staff are safe and free from physical or
emotional harm, whether this is from bullying, harassment, crime, or any other threat. Feeling
safe in the school environment makes students more willing to attend, participate, and build
positive relationships. When we talk about school safety, we don’t emphasize only physical
safety and keeping the school grounds free of violence. School safety also includes protecting
the social environment and relationships. We will take a much deeper dive into safety shortly,
for now, here is a look at the different facets of school safety. Flip through the ﬂashcards below.
Physical Saftey: This is what often comes to mind when thinking about safety: it
means being free from threats of violence, crime, natural disasters, diseases, or other physical harm. 
Emotional Saftey: This refers to feeling safe and secure in expressing and managing emotions at school. Students in emotionally safe climates feel that they belong, can express themselves, and have a network of support. Positive health and wellbeing (PHW) are important components for maintaining emotional safety. You will learn more about  PHW in the next lesson entitled “Creating and Implementing Schoolwide Expectations.”
Bullying & Cyberbullying: Bullying is another concern that many students face in the school setting that can be disruptive to physical and emotional safety and greatly impact mental health. For more information about bullying, keep going with this lesson!   
Substance Abuse: Safety from substance abuse protects students from harm relating to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or other substances. Schools with safety from substance abuse promote healthy habits and reduce or eliminate student exposure to harmful substances.  
Emergency Readiness & Management: his refers to safety from emergencies relating to violence, natural disasters, accidents, or epidemics. This level of safety involves having and acting on plans as needed. This includes the stages of prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.

By understanding the importance of environment, engagement, and safety, educators can
cultivate a conducive atmosphere for learning and personal growth. Let's now delve deeper into
how these key school climate elements affect not just student academic success, but also
behavior and the mental well-being of all within the school community.

Considering the Far-Reaching Impact of School Climate
School climate is an extensive concept that ripples through every corner of the educational
landscape. As mentioned earlier, school climate inﬂuences student academic performance and
also students' social interactions and responses to disciplinary measures. Click through these
topics to understand how climate is profoundly connected to student outcomes.
Academics  –
Grades/Test Scores: School climate impacts a student’s learning. A positive school climate can
help students feel supported, motivated, and capable. Feeling safe and comfortable allows
students to focus on learning without other concerns taking precedence, ultimately impacting
grades and test scores. On the other hand, in a negative school climate, students may lack a sense
of belonging, feel unmotivated to participate in school activities, or be concerned about their
safety, all of which detract from learning.  
Attendance: Students are more likely to attend school when they feel safe, comfortable, and
supported. In a survey of youth, 15% of students reported skipping school because of feeling
unsafe within the past school year (CDC, 2019). Fostering a positive school climate and school
safety can help increase attendance and reduce the number of students who are chronically
absent. For a more in-depth look at the relationship between school climate and student
absenteeism download this article from the Journal of School Psychology, entitledHow School
Climate Relates to Chronic Absence: A Multi-level Latent Proﬁle Analysis.
Graduation Rate: Students who feel unwelcome and unsupported are less likely to want to
participate meaningfully in classes and academic work, increasing the likelihood of falling behind
academically. Students who miss more school because of a negative environment are also more
likely to fall behind academically and ultimately drop out (National Institutes of Health, 2020).
Fostering a safe and supportive school climate makes students more likely to attend school and
more likely to engage effectively with the school environment.   

Behavior and Discipline –
Behavior both reﬂects and inﬂuences school climate. In a positive school climate, students are
more likely to want to follow rules, to feel respected and supported, and to treat others with
respect. On the other hand, a negative school climate can also inﬂuence behavior and vice versa.
In a school with many negative behaviors, like violence and bullying, students and educators are
less likely to feel safe and comfortable.  
Discipline can also impact school climate. A positive and effective discipline system sets up clear
expectations for students and teachers, supports an environment where all students feel that they
belong, and cultivates respect between teachers and students. An ineffective discipline system can
lead to a higher rate of behavior problems, which can make students feel uncomfortable or
unsafe, distract attention away from learning, and contribute to teacher dissatisfaction and
burnout.  
School discipline systems may be overly strict, harsh, or punitive, which can contribute to
students' negative feelings, such as low self-esteem or feeling as though they don't belong. One
way that this can happen is through exclusionary discipline. Exclusionary discipline is any
discipline that removes students from the school environment, such as suspensions and
expulsions. Overuse of exclusionary discipline can lead to students feeling disconnected from and
unwelcome in the school environment. Use of this type of discipline can also increase the
likelihood of future behavior problems. Students from minoritized backgrounds are also more
likely to receive exclusionary discipline, contributing to disproportionality.
For more information on responding to student behavior, review "Creating and Implementing
Expectations" later in this course.

School climate can have an impact on student mental
health and the overall wellbeing of the school community
A positive school climate can help support positive mental health outcomes for students. On the
other hand, the incidence of mental health concerns directly correlates to a negative school
climate. For example, a school climate riddled with high rates of bullying can increase the
likelihood of students experiencing depression, anxiety, or substance use.  
Additionally, a school environment that lacks awareness and understanding of mental health
and mental health concerns may perpetuate misconceptions and biases surrounding
individuals experiencing mental health issues. School-wide programming that serves to reduce
stigma and increase mental health literacy can help provide a safer space for students in the
school, promote better self-esteem for students with mental health concerns, and increase
help-seeking behaviors.  

Supporting student mental health needs through climate
and safety MTSS practices
As you may already know from experience, comprehensive school mental health systems
nurture positive student outcomes. These systems offer a range of supports and services at
different levels to help improve school climate, foster social and emotional development,
enhance mental health and overall wellbeing, and contribute to a decrease in the prevalence and
intensity of mental health concerns.
Some of the most effective supports are
- using strength-based approaches
- working together with students and their parents/caregivers
- integrating MTSS practices that are evidenced-based, rely on data, and involve continuous
evaluation and quality improvement. 
Let’s further explore these key practices by examining the graphic below that illustrates how
these mental health supports address the critical needs for enhancing school climate and
promoting school safety.
IMAGE HERE
A graphic illustrating core components for supporting student mental health needs
School climate also inffuences educators, administrators, and other school staff,
shaping their experiences, attitudes, and effectiveness. Characteristics of a negative
school climate can contribute to stress and burnout for the educators in the school,
which can ultimately lead to reduced job satisfaction and high rates of turnover. A
positive school climate empowers educators, fosters a community of inclusion and
respect, and reduces stress. The upcoming lesson Wellness Enhancement for School
Staff will delve into educator burnout, stress issues, and wellness promotion
strategies targeting adults within the school building.

A Closer Look at School Safety
Understanding how School Climate and Safety are Interconnected
As mentioned earlier in the lesson, school climate and school safety share an intricate
relationship. Where the climate is the pattern over time,school safety is like the daily
weather: it is dynamic and can change rapidly. Just like a sunny day can turn stormy, even a safe
school environment can encounter safety concerns, such as violence. Thankfully, just like
checking and preparing for weather changes, schools can also prepare for potential safety
threats by implementing safety measures.
Preparing for the weather and assuring a safe school environment both involve being proactive
and taking necessary steps to reduce risk. Step one? Understand why students may be engaging
in school violence. Read on.

Uncovering Risks and Cultivating Resilience
Risk and protective factors help explain why a problem exists and why certain individuals or
groups are more or less likely to become victims of violence or become involved in violence.
Let’s begin with the risks.
Factors that can contribute to incidents of school
violence
You may recall from other lessons that risk factors are associated with
higher negative outcomes.The chart below examines in more detail a
combination of individual, relationship, community, and societal factors
that contribute to the risk of youth violence.

Table illustrating risk factors for school violence
It's important to note that not everyone exposed to these risk factors will engage in violent
behavior, however a complex interplay of the various risk factors can contribute to increased
chances of such incidents occurring. It is important for school administration, educators, and
all school staff to understand the possible risk factors that increase the likelihood of school
violence. With this knowledge, schools can improve the ability to detect problems, intervene
early, and minimize the chances of serious violence. 
Let's watch a video provided by the CDC to learn more
about what can put individuals at risk for violence and
what things can act as a protective buffer.
Moving Forward
Moving Forward
As can be seen from the video, a combination of experiences can contribute to school violence.
The risk of experiencing or participating in violence can either be increased or decreased
depending on the positive or negative factors in an individual's life.
Protective factors and measures to foster a safe school
environment
Now that we have discussed how exposure to violence and other risk factors can signiﬁcantly
impact a student's behavior and well-being let's examine certain protective factors that play a
role in enhancing resilience and reducing the likelihood of a student engaging in violence at
school.
TABLE HERE
Table illustrating protective factors that serve to minimize school violence
When students feel connected to their school, engaged in meaningful activities, and supported
by family, friends, and educators, they are less likely to resort to violence. A positive school
environment fosters a sense of purpose and promotes prosocial behaviors.

Resources for Enhancing School Safety
While we cannot guarantee a violent incident will never
occur at our school or in our community, there are
measures we can take to reduce the probability.

Taking Immediate Action
Being Prepared for on-the-spot Responses to Crisis
Preparedness is essential for educators to effectively respond to immediate student crises or
school violence. In the event of such incidents, quick and informed actions can mitigate harm,
ensure safety, and provide necessary support. Administrators, educators, and staff need
training to recognize warning signs, establish communication protocols, and implement crisis
response plans. This readiness empowers them to swiftly intervene, provide aid, and collaborate
with emergency services, ultimately minimizing the impact of crises on students and
promoting a secure learning environment.

Averting School Violence
School violence refers to any form of physical, emotional, or psychological harm inﬂicted upon
students, educators, or staff members within the school setting. School violence encompasses a
range of aggressive behaviors that compromise the safety, wellbeing, and conducive learning
atmosphere of schools. Instances of school violence can manifest in various ways, such as
physical ﬁghts between students, bullying and harassment, verbal abuse, cyberbullying
through online platforms, and even more severe incidents like ﬁghts, weapon possession, or
acts of vandalism. The scope of school violence extends beyond physical harm, encompassing
emotional and psychological abuse, which can include social exclusion, spreading rumors, and
intimidation. These acts not only jeopardize individual safety but also impede the overall
educational experience for everyone involved. 
The possibilities of averting school violence are promising when approached through proactive
strategies. For example, fostering strong connections between students, teachers, and
parents/caregivers, through open communication channels can create supportive networks
that can identify and address potential issues before they escalate.
Insights gained from extensive research shed light on the effectiveness of preventive measures.
Between 1999 and 2017, the Averted School Violence Database, established to enhance the
understanding of averted and completed school attacks, identiﬁed 51 instances that were
prevented (Daniels, 2019). Although these ﬁndings only provide a preliminary overview, they
offer valuable suggestions and recommendations into the dynamics of averting school violence.
As you explore these recommendations below, always remember that having knowledge of
these averted attacks will inﬂuence our next action steps in reducing the likelihood of school
violence happening. Let’s examine these recommendations.
- Prepare for possible school-based crises: Law enforcement can prepare by being actively involved in planning emergency operations, developing
command communication structures with first responders, and clarifying roles and responsibilities in
reunification protocols.
- Develop relationships: Form relationships between law enforcement, school personnel (including school staff such as custodians
and cafeteria employees), and—most importantly—students.
- Know and work to improve the school’s climate: It is imperative that school staff are aware of the climate of the school and pay attention when students are singled out for bullying. They need to respond immediately and appropriately to this behavior.
- Know the physical facility and its important features: Law enforcement and first responders should know the layout of the school property, school emergency operations procedures, and ways to access technology such as cameras.
- Take all reports seriously and assume nothing: School violence can be planned and carried out at any type of school, any school level, and any location.
Apart from these recommendations, please examine the graphic below to visualize ﬁve
strategies to help prevent school violence. Click to enlarge.

Responding in the Moment
Effectively responding to behavior is critical in providing a safe school environment. When
crises are about to happen (e.g., someone is beginning to lose control), you need to use safe,
respectful, and non-invasive methods for managing disruptive and assaultive student behavior.
Review the ﬂashcards below for guidance in responding to student misbehavior.
- Deescalating yourself first: Before approaching a crisis situation, deescalate yourself first: remain calm and composed. Don’t run and scream at the student to change the behavior. Instead, walk to the student and calmly address the misbehavior. Be mindful that if you approach the student aggressively, you may also contribute to the escalation of the student.  Our goal is to effectively correct the student and deescalate them. This may be easier said than done, but you can get help from the Nonviolent Crisis Intervention program developed by the Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI). This program offers training that not only teaches staff to respond effectively to the warning signs that someone is beginning to lose control, but also addresses how teachers and staff can deal with their own stress, anxieties, and emotions when confronted with these challenging situations. 
- Asses the situation: Assess the situation: Determine the level of threat to yourself and others and take action to ensure safety. This involves considering factors such as the nature and intensity of behavior, presence of weapons, emotional state, history of similar actions, triggers, environment, communication of threats, physical capacity, and behavior duration. These factors, interconnected and evaluated collectively, guide informed decisions to ensure safety in each situation.
- Crisis Response team: crisis response team: If the situation becomes dangerous, don't hesitate to call for help. In schools, there is a trained team responsible for responding to crises. Have the designated, trained person go into the classroom (or where the incident is happening). Response teams could include administrators, school counselors, and School Resource Officers (SROs).
- Restrain: Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) also provides restraint training, but only after there is a complete understanding of the risks, dangers, and liabilities of using the techniques. Because of the inherent instabilities involved, restraining should be your last resort in preventing harm and must be used only in emergency situations with an understanding of the risks involved.
- Power Struggle: Power struggle: Power struggles in schools can disrupt the handling of safety concerns. Conflicts among staff about safety strategies can hinder effective action. This can extend to conflicts between adults and students, leading to disruptions. To mitigate this, open communication and collaboration are crucial. Resolving conflicts with empathy and de-escalation strategies helps maintain a safe learning environment. Prioritizing teamwork, respect, and clear communication minimizes conflicts and focuses on student safety and growth.
- Student should know what to expect: Students should know what to expect: If a student is called-out for misbehavior, they should know what to expect. It is also important for the adults in the situation to know what the expectations are to minimize confusion. Routine helps prevent escalation. You will learn more about creating those expectations and communicating them clearly to all students in the next lesson!

It is important to remember that every situation is different and may require a unique response.
The goal should always be to maintain safety and resolve the situation in a calm and effective
manner. Be sure to check out our extremely enlightening and informative lesson on Crisis
Management!
Remember that having caring and nurturing relationships with students is of utmost
signiﬁcance. Many diffcult situations have been prevented because students have opened up to
trusted adults in the school setting.
Keeping schools safe requires multidisciplinary planning and implementation. Comprehensive
school safety and security plans address prevention, response, and recovery from crisis events.

Safety Working Group. 2020., Washington, DC Offce of Community Oriented Policing Services).

Exposing Bullying as a Major Threat to School Safety
Analyzing the Signiﬁcant Impact on Overall School Climate and
Safety
The fact is that in a school with a positive school climate, students are more likely to feel safe
from bullying and less likely to feel the need to engage in bullying behavior. Conversely, in a
school where many students are bullied, students don't feel safe.

What Is Bullying?
Bullying is an extremely signiﬁcant issue impacting school climate and school safety. In a
school where many students are bullied, students feel less safe. In a school with a positive
school climate, students are more likely to feel safe from bullying and less likely to feel the need
to engage in bullying behavior. Bullying is a very common issue in the school setting: around
20% of students nationwide, and 23% of students in South Carolina, have experienced bullying
during grades 9-12 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). This number is also
higher for students of certain identities. In 9th-12th grade students, around 40% of LGBTQ
students, 30% of girls, and 30% of white students have experienced bullying at school or online,
compared to 19% of boys, 19% of African American students, and 18% of Hispanic students
(Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).  It is important to note here that while these
statistics are for high school students, bullying is also prevalent (and frequently begins) in
middle schools and elementary schools.
Before learning more about bullying, let’s look at how to deﬁne it. There are many ways that
students may mistreat each other, get into disagreements, or otherwise be harmed—so how do
we know when actions indicate bullying? It is essential to make this distinction because
responses to other types of aggression are different from the responses that are needed to
address bullying. Bullying is deﬁned by the CDC as:  
“Any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by
another youth or group of youths, who are not
siblings or current dating partners, that involves
an observed or perceived power imbalance, and
is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be
repeated.”   - CDC, 2021
Let’s unpack this deﬁnition. First, bullying is unwanted aggressive behavior. This could be
behavior that’s mean or hurtful, like name-calling and hitting, or any other aggressive behavior
that results in some type of harm—physically, emotionally, or both.
The next part of the deﬁnition involves an observed or perceived power imbalance. Some things
that may contribute to a power imbalance include an older age, bigger size, higher social status,
popularity, or strength in numbers—a group of students compared to a single student, for
example. In a power imbalance, it is unlikely that having a child being bullied to ask the other
child to stop or apologize will be successful.
The last part of the deﬁnition involves behavior that is repeated multiple times or highly likely to
be repeated. This means that behavior is not a one-time occurrence but happens again and
again.  
This deﬁnition plays out in many different ways. When thinking about bullying, one common
stereotype is the “tough kid” who is bigger than all the other kids, often gets into ﬁghts, steals
other children’s lunch money, and has a tough home life. However, bullying is much more than
this. The CDC identiﬁes ﬁve types of bullying:
- Physical—hitting, kicking, punching 
- Verbal—name-calling or teasing 
- Relational/Social—intentional exclusion, spreading rumors, damaging relationships 
- Damage to property—stealing or breaking another student’s personal belongings 
-  Cyberbullying—online bullying: name calling, posting or commenting  
Just as there are many different forms of bullying, there are also many different reasons
students bully. Understanding this perspective can help us more effectively respond to bullying
behavior.
Here are some common reasons that students may bully others.
- Maintain social status by excluding others or controlling behavior of others
- Experience of family abuse, aggression, or violence
- Family with limited emotional support or low parental involvement
- Prior experiences being bullied
- Low self-esteem and insecurity
- Not understanding or empathizing with the emotions of others
Sometimes students who bully are called “bullies” or students who are bullied are called
“victims.” While these descriptions can be helpful, the label of a “bully” or a “victim” can
cause a child to feel as though their role is set and unchangeable, while this does not have
to be true.
Students who bully can be bullied, students who are bullied can also bully others, and
students are not deffned by either of these roles.  

Effects of Bullying
Regardless of the role being played, bullying has many, sometimes long-lasting, effects.
Students who are bullied, who bully others, and who are bystanders are more likely to
experience:  
- Increased anxiety, depression, self-harm, or substance use 
- Reduced interest in activities
- Increased feelings of isolation or loneliness 
- Increased likelihood of missing or skipping school and/or dropping out 
- Decreased academic performance, including grades and test scores

How to Respond to Bullying
Knowing that bullying can have these negative impacts on students, it is important to have a
plan for how to respond to bullying when it is witnessed. Bystanders, those who witness
bullying, have the potential to impact bullying as it is happening, either positively or negatively.
Bystanders can have various roles: peers, teachers, administrators, friends, family members, or
others. Depending on your role, you may respond differently.  
There are different types of responses to bullying behavior as a bystander. Flip through the
cards below to review how people respond.
- Reinforcers: These bystanders reinforce the bullying behavior. While they may
not be bullying themselves, they may laugh, cheer, or otherwise support the bullying.
- Outsiders: These bystanders see the bullying but do not participate, either by
bullying or being bullied. They also do not help, encourage, or discourage bullying: they only
witness it.
- Assistants: Assistants are like reinforcers but are more directly involved and
actively support bullying.
- Defenders: Defenders witness the bullying incident and take steps to
intervene. They may directly call out the behavior, ask the person
bullying to stop, or otherwise attempt to prevent the bullying from continuing.  

When bystanders intervene, bullying stops within 10 seconds 57% of the
time (stopbullying.gov, 2018). This shows the importance of
interveningin bullying incidents for students, educators, and anyone else
who may witness it.  
While it is important to intervene in bullying incidents, there are also some common reasons
why people may not intervene as listed below (CDC, 2018).   
- Concern about how intervening may impact their social status 
- Fear of retaliation or becoming the target of bullying
- Not knowing that the incident is bullying— they do not have enough information about the situation, or they do not know how to deﬁne bullying 
- Concern that they will not help the situation, or could make the situation worse
- Desire to intervene but not knowing how
Understanding these reasons can help educators and students best determine how to improve
their ability and willingness to respond. For example, if a school ﬁnds that many teachers want
to respond to bullying but do not know how, they can provide training on response strategies.
Having a strong response to bullying can help cultivate a positive school climate where respect
is valued and negative behaviors are discouraged, reducing the frequency of these behaviors and
improving school safety.

Analyzing the effectiveness of strategies used in
response to school bullying
There are many potential responses to bullying. In The Youth Voice Project (Davis and Nixon,
2013), 13,000 students were surveyed on whether responses to bullying were helpful, harmful,
or had no effect on them.
The graph below shows some of the common responses, as well as the percentage of students
who found the approach helpful. Click the image to enlarge.
IMAGE HERE
A graph summarizing the effectiveness of different bullying response strategies
There are many takeaways from this data: one thing to note is that the least helpful responses—
telling the person to stop, doing nothing, and pretending it didn’t bother me—are often given
as advice to students who experience bullying. While every bullying situation is different, these
data suggest that other approaches may be more helpful.  
Another takeaway from this data was that sometimes, adult responses are not helpful. When the
same students were surveyed to identify speciﬁc approaches that were most helpful from
adults, the results were again ranked from most to least helpful:
IMAGE HERE  
A graph displaying effectiveness of adult responses to bullying
For peers, the results had similar rates of effectiveness: 
IMAGE HERE
A graph depicting effectiveness of peer responses to bullying
Putting all this data together, the most helpful responses are listening to and spending time
with the person being bullied, while the least helpful responses involve ignoring the problem or
blaming the person being bullied. Again, while every bullying situation may be different and
require a different response, what is most likely to be helpful involves listening to and spending
time with the person being bullied, either as a peer or an adult.

Bullying Prevention Programs
There are several programs available to help prevent bullying. These programs vary in their
approaches, but each aims to create a safe and respectful school environment while
equipping students and educators with the skills needed to prevent and address bullying
behavior.
The Bully Prevention in Positive Behavior Support(BP-PBS) curriculum aligns with the
principles of positive behavior support and aims to create a safe and nurturing school climate
where bullying is less likely to occur. It draws on evidence-based practices to address the
various aspects of bullying, from prevention to intervention, with the goal of fostering a positive
and respectful school community. The curriculum is geared towards the elementary school
level.

Enhancing School Climate and Promoting a Safe
School Environment 
Implementing Climate and Safety Initiatives within your School's
MTSS Framework
Collaborative Roles for School Climate and Safety
Understanding bullying, responding to crises, and taking measures to avert school violence are
important and immediate school climate factors. However, creating a sustained positive school
climate is a complex undertaking that all members of the school community can help support.
All members of the school community can help support a positive school climate. To review
roles of each member of the community, read the tabs below.  
State, District, or School Administrators –
State, district, and school administrators are leaders who can set the stage for successful
implementation of a positive school climate throughout entire schools or districts. They can
review data, serve on District Community Leadership Teams (DCLTs) and school-based teams,
and make decisions on which interventions to start, continue, or discontinue. Administrators can
also form policies and advocate for the importance of building a positive school climate. 
Teachers  –
Teachers also help support school climate. Teachers can inﬂuence school climate in their
individual classrooms. Adopting culturally responsive practices, involving families and
communities, and building strong and positive relationships with students can all contribute to
positive school climate. Teachers can also serve as positive role models for students.  
School Support Staff –
School support staff may include anyone working with a school aside from teachers and
administrators. These staff may be school social workers, counselors or psychologists, reading
specialists, nurses, or others in supportive roles in the school. These staff inﬂuence school climate
at the Tier 1 level, and at the Tier 2 and 3 levels for students who receive specialized interventions. 
School Resource Offfcers –
School resource offcers (SROs) are in the school setting to provide a safe learning environment,
enforce school discipline, and prevent and intervene in any school violence. The National
Association of School Resource Offcers (NASRO) aims to protect all students by providing
valuable resources to school staff while fostering positive relationships with students and
implementing best practices to prevent school violence. NASRO deﬁnes the main roles of SROs as
a “triad concept” where they can be: (1) educators, (2) informal counselors, and (3) law
enforcement offcers.
For more information about the SROs, please keep going with the lesson!
Family  –
School-family partnerships also contribute to school climate. Strong school-family-
partnerships with bidirectional communication provide opportunities for schools and families to
align expectations and values, build strong relationships, and support each other. To review more
information about school-family partnerships, review our lessons in Core MTSS and in this Tier 1
Module!
Community  –
Like families, communities contribute to a positive school climate through partnerships with the
school. Further, communities provide the context for understanding and appreciating the
strengths and challenges that surround the lives of students in your school.


Implementing School Climate and Safety Practices within the MTSS Framework
Developing and sustaining a positive school climate involves proactive measures that address
problems before they become major concerns. A strong integrated MTSS enables targeted
support for enhancing school climate and safety at all three tiers, with foundational
preventative initiatives in place at the Tier 1, or universal, level. Successful implementation
allows all students to feel safe, supported, and better able to focus on learning and growing.
IMAGE HERE
A graphic illustrating Multi-Tiered System of Supports triangle
A positive school climate emerges from intentional safety-focused initiatives and
environmental enhancement practices. Schools can utilize the critical features of the MTSS
(data-informed decision making, collaborative teamwork, professional development, family
and community engagement) to support sustained implementation of evidence-based school
safety practices and ongoing monitoring of school climate.

Using data to make decisions about positive school climate practices
According to the Safe Supportive Schools Model, there are ﬁve steps to improving school
climate that can be thought of as a cycle. Data is taken to determine how things are going. Using
that data, interventions are evaluated, and decisions are made to continue, improve, or replace
interventions. Changes are planned and then implemented. Then, the cycle begins again! For
more details, review the graphic below. Click to enlarge the image.

Cycle of School Climate Enhancement
Let's look at each step of the cycle in more detail!
Supporting School Climate
The aim here is to consistently optimize students' academic success, emotional
development, and overall life outcomes while minimizing the risk of negative
behaviors and incidents. Scroll through for more information

Step 1: Review and Evaluate Data 
As mentioned earlier, improving school climate in the MTSS framework involves
making use of the data that is available to you. There are several sources of data for
measuring school climate, such as these:
- Attendance data 
- Academic data: grades, test scores, graduation rates 
- Behavioral data: offce discipline referrals (ODRs)  
Surveys and feedback:  
- PBIS Center Surveys—the PBIS Center has several surveys available for families,
staff, and students to assess the various aspects of school climate. For a full guide
and link to these surveys, review the document below, PBIS School Climate
Surveys.pdf 
- School Safety Surveys (SSSs)— some school climate surveys focus on safety
speciﬁcally. 
Please recall that Tier 1 supports are universal meaning that ALL students are assessed
with these surveys.
Remember from the Core MTSS course, you learned about needs assessment and
progress monitoring. In supporting school climate, we use needs assessment and
progress monitoring data on student outcomes to support students' behavioral,
social, emotional, and academic needs.
Data can be used at the individual, family, and community levels. Review each in the
next section of this lesson.

Step 2: Assess Current Programmatic Interventions 
The next step in the process is to assess the current interventions that are in place.
Important questions to ask at this stage are:  
- What interventions are being used, if any? 
- What does the data suggest about the effectiveness of these programs? 
- What are the priority challenges and needs in our school that could be addressed
through intervention? 

Step 3 Select Programmatic Interventions
Using the information you've gotten from analyzing your data and assessing your
interventions, the next step is to select which programs to start, continue, or
discontinue. There are many options for programmatic interventions that are
available for use in the school setting to address climate at the Tier 1 level. Here are
some examples of programmatic interventions.
- Schoolwide PBIS
- Stop Bullying Now
- Olweus Bullying Prevention Program
- Restorative Practices
- Mental health literacy programs
- Positive health and wellbeing universal programming

Step 4 Plan Changes 
The next step is to plan the implementation of the intervention selected. Important
questions to ask at this stage are:  
- What is the process for adapting this intervention? 
- Who will be involved with implementation, and what will their role be? 
- When will we start implementation? 
- How will we monitor our progress? 

Step 5 Implement Changes 
At this stage, the planning from Step 4 is put into action! With solid planning as a
foundation, you are ready to begin implementing changes. 
Summary
Once changes are being implemented, the next step is to once again review data and
evaluate, restarting the cycle! School climate improvement is far from a one-time
event: it is a continual process.  


Different Levels of Data
As mentioned in the steps above, data can be used at the individual,
family, and community levels.
- Individual Level: You can use the SSSs result and look for factors that can increase students' risk of being involved in being victims of crime or violence. After identifying these factors, you can encourage your students to be involved in various preventive activities. Some examples of these activities include conﬂict-resolution classes and skill-building training groups or intergenerational projects where community elders share knowledge and traditions with youth.
- Family and Peer Levels: At the family or peer levels, your goal should be enhancing the strength and well-being of ALL families, caregivers, and peers. You can achieve this by encouraging families, caregivers, and peers to involve themselves in activities including mentoring programs for
parents/caregivers, after-school programs involving parents/caregivers, and peer mentoring programs. These mentoring programs promote social skills and positive attitudes and behaviors. These activities support skill development in parents and caregivers, especially those who care for youth who may be at risk for violence.
- Community and School Levels: At the community and school levels, the results of the SSSs should lead you in directions to increase schools’ and communities' ability to prevent crime and victimization. At this level, activities should promote community cooperation for crime prevention through social development and will involve various stakeholders including schools, teachers, social agencies, and parents/caregivers. These prevention activities could include holding public meetings or workshops on community issues, developing community action plans, building public awareness and consensus building, running school-based anti-bullying campaigns, or creating networks and coalitions to address crime and victimization problems. 

School-wide Practices to Help Support Positive School Climate

surveys, review the link below.
School Climate Survey Compendium
As States, districts and schools explore measuring school climate, one of the
biggest questions they have is about which survey to use. It can be diffcult to
know which surveys are valid and reliable, what they measure, and which are
free.
READ MORE ED 
School Safety Surveys (SSSs) are used to determine risk and protective factors for
schools. In the Core MTSS course, you learned about team-based leadership. These same
teams use SSS results to assess risk and protective factors. SSS also helps you determine
what training and support may be needed to address school safety and violence
prevention in the school.
Implementing practices geared toward building and
maintaining strong relationships
There are many relationships in a school: as you likely know from experience, everyone in the
school is interconnected in various ways. For example, there are relationships between:
- Students and other students
- Students and teachers
- Students and administrators
- Teachers and administrators
- Teachers and other teachers
- School support staff and teachers
…and many more! The way that various groups are treated makes a big difference in the climate
of the school and how welcomed, safe, and supported everyone feels.  
Strong student-to-teacher relationships are extremely important in supporting a positive
school climate. While teachers often want to build strong relationships with students, they may
face challenges along the way. When this happens, it is important to have a plan for what to do.
An Establish-Maintain-Restore model is one approach for this, which you brieﬂy touched on in
the previous lesson: "Elevating Family and Student Engagement" (Cook, 2018). This method
involves three steps to building strong relationships:  
1 Establish the relationship: From the start, be intentional to build a strong student-
teacher relationship. The goal at this stage is to build trust, foster acceptance, and
gain understanding. This time given to building relationships is called “banking.”
Teachers make “deposits” of time and energy that help build up a strong and
meaningful relationship that can be called on in more diffcult times.  
2 Maintain the relationship: The next step is to maintain these relationships through
ongoing positive interactions. It is recommended to have a ratio of 5:1 for positive to
negative interactions with students (Cook, 2017). Examples of positive interactions
may include compliments, empathy, positive greetings in the morning, praise for
schoolwork or behavior, and any other positive statements. Negative interactions
may include misunderstandings, disagreements, discipline or other negative
statements.  
3 Restore the relationship:This phase addresses how to respond
to negative interactions. While it is helpful to try to prevent
negative interactions as much as possible, it is very common
that they may still occur, so it’s also important to be able to
respond as effectively as possible to move forward in the
relationship. 
Restoring the relationship can be particularly challenging. Here are ﬁve methods for restoring
the relationship (Cook, 2018).
- letting go of the previous event
- taking responsibility for or ownership of the problem 
- validating student feelings with an empathy statement 
- solving problems collaboratively 
- making a statement of care by separating the deed from the doer 
The use of these ﬁve methods will likely depend on the speciﬁc situation and student, and
combinations of these methods may also be needed. However, across all situations, the core
values of empathy and respect can go a long way in supporting positive relationships.
For a video on building relationships through daily
handshakes, watch the video below!
VIDEO HERE
This video highlights fifth-grade teacher Barry White Jr. of Ashley Park Elementary
School in Charlotte, North Carolina, and how he greets his students with special
handshakes every day before they enter class.
Simply arriving at school in the morning is such an important part of the day. Students bring in
whatever happened last night or right before school, and greetings are just one of the many
ways educators can, and are, "checking in" with each student.
Here is a video about the importance of greeting students at the door!
Greeting Students at the Door || Is it Worth the Extra Time?
Additional Efforts to Support Positive School Climate
Let's examine the best practices and key stakeholders—
so you know your role and others—in promoting
positive school climate and safe schools.
The practices aimed at fostering a positive school climate can be categorized into three distinct
sections based on their impact, priority, and effort it takes to implement. They are:
- Short term practices: These are the easiest and quickest to implement to address a
need. You can use these practices to quickly identify and ﬁnd solutions to a
situation. These are in the graphic's blue column below.
- Medium term practices: These will take some time and have a meaningful impact.
Implementing these strategies may take medium effort. These are in the graphic's
white column below.
- Long term practices: These will require the most effort yet will have a greater
impact. Implementing these practices will require extensive time and development.
These are in the graphic's green column below.
In implementing these strategies, we suggest you use a range of short-, medium- and long-
term practices.
When implementing these new practices, always be mindful of the existing strategies in the
school setting. To avoid confusion and remain effective, either integrate new practices into
existing ones or limit the implementation of new ones.
Another thing to consider is that starting small and going big is fruitful! When you start small
and support school safety through school climate efforts, you are more likely to be successful.
Always remember to celebrate successes, whether they are small or big! 
Explore the practice below.
Short term, Identify hotspot: Where are the hotspots? Look for and observe the unsafe areas in the school. These areas may be
playgrounds, under stairwells, or in other locations. Once you find these hotspots, talk with students and
ask them how they feel about their safety in these areas. If you are unable to locate these hotspots, and
students do not want to talk about them, provide them with a map of the school and color code the areas
(for example, green being the safest area and red being the least safe).
Key stakeholders: Teachers, school counselors, and other school personnel are engaged in this practice.
Be sure to also include students and understand their perspectives. This approach will also make students
feel heard!
Short term, Respond to stressful or painful events: Observe and document what students express about stressful or painful events. Then engage with students
about these events. Understanding how students feel about these events will help you promote school
climate and safety as you see the bigger picture and better understand how the issues impact them. 
Key stakeholders: This practice includes teachers, students, parents and caregivers and other members of
the school community.
Medium term, Personal commitments: Encourage students and all staff to create and reflect upon personal commitments to the— work of
improving and enhancing school safety. These commitments will promote a sense of accountability and
responsibility.
Key Stakeholders: Engage all school personnel and students in this practice. Students can practice writing
these commitments as part of their instructional time. For school staff and other professionals, this work
can be done during departmental meetings and/or in professional learning communities.
Medium term, Creating classroom expectations: Creating classroom expectations is another way to promote school climate and safety. When creating
classroom expectations, it is important to involve students. When students are involved in creating
classroom norms and management, they are more likely to obey these norms and less likely to misbehave.
For more information about classroom expectations, continue to our lesson on “Creating and
Implementing Schoolwide Expectations.” 
Key Stakeholders: The key stakeholders in creating classroom expectations are students, and classroom
teachers.
Medium term, consider byu-in from educators early in the year: It is essential for all educators involved with promoting school climate and safety to be on the same page and willing to participate. To address the potential resistance from adults in promoting all facets of school
safety, it is beneficial to initially assess areas of discomfort. Surveying teachers and staff about potential
concerns they may have can help address these issues and ensure buy-in. 
Key Stakeholders: Engage all staff. This is most effective in all-staff meetings at the start of the school
year so that all school personnel, not just teachers, are included and their voices are heard.
Medium term, ongoing discipline policy review:Use discipline data to identify the discipline policies that are most used. Identify whether the policies are overused. To make sure that the policies are appropriate, you can also align school policies with district
vision statements. Holding focus groups with teachers, principals, parents, and student groups allows for
the identification of pain points for each stakeholder group. Another step districts can take is to develop
MOUs with school resource officers that are based on best practices and reflect their responsibilities in
district policy.
Key Stakeholders: School district level staff, parents and caregivers, and students are the stakeholders
here, ensuring all voices are heard.
Medium term, Similar to the earlier recommendation to include students in developing their classroom norms,
promoting student engagement and the student voice is important for effective school climate
improvement efforts. When students are given the opportunity to be heard and to participate in
schoolwide initiatives, there is a greater likelihood of successful efforts. This success, in turn, creates a
safer school environment.
Key Stakeholders: Here, the key stakeholders are your students! Get students involved to have them
heard!
long term, have morning meeting with students: Implementing morning meetings daily or weekly can help you develop stronger ties with your students.
These could be short 10 to 15-minute check-ins to support student needs across the school year.
Key Stakeholders: Teachers and students are the key stakeholders but  provide support to teachers by also
identifying additional school staff to engage with students on a regular basis through a defined schedule.
Analyze student performance data: To have effective outcomes, teams need to develop systems and processes for analyzing student behavior
and academic performance data on an ongoing basis. Educators should set outcome goals for each student
or cluster of students who are below, at, and above the target objective level. Performance data should
include both academic and non-academic indicators of student success.
Key Stakeholders: School support staff, classroom teachers, administrators, and non-licensed classroom
staff are all stakeholders for this practice.

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- School climate refers to the environment of a school and has a signiﬁcant impact
on how students, teachers, and staff experience the school setting
- The goal is to create a positive school climate and a safe school environment for all
students, school staff, and parents/caregivers by preventing and responding
quickly to violence in schools
- Be proactive, rather than waiting for violence to happen. Proactive approaches are
always the most effective in addressing challenges with school safety
- Bullying is a common concern for students that can negatively impact school
climate and safety. There are many programs and strategies for preventing and
reducing bullying that can be used to help prevent it
- When enhancing school climate and averting school violence, implement the
evidence-based strategies and practices as recommended in this lesson. In
implementing these approaches, be mindful that a one-size-ﬁts-all approach does
not work for preventing school violence. Always use data to ensure that
programming is having the intended impact
- Relationship enhancement is one way to improve school climate and safety. To
enhance relationships, you can use the Establish-Maintain-Restore (EMR) model
- A combination of short-, medium-, and long-term practices can help promote
school climate and school safety

Outcomes:
1. Analyze expectations within the school context
2. Demonstrate the importance of schoolwide expectations as they relate to academics,
behavior, and positive health and wellbeing
3. Identify and explain the process of creating academic, behavioral, and positive health
and wellbeing expectations
4. Address practically implementing schoolwide expectations
5. Critically evaluate responses to students when expectations are or are not met

Expecting...the Expected?
Expectations in the School Setting
What to Expect When You're Expecting 's book cover
In 1984, Heidi Murkoff published What to Expect When You're Expecting. This pregnancy guide
used a question-and-answer format to address common worries or curiosities expecting
parents had about their pregnancy. Since its publication, What to Expect When You're
Expectinghas sold more than 42 million copies, was turned into a movie by Lionsgate in 2012,
and expanded into an online community with a website and app.
Whether it's about pregnancy, job offers, or how your dog will behave at the dog
park, everyone has expectations for everyone and everything.
The popularity of What to Expect When You're Expectingshows how much value people place on
understanding expectations. The importance of deﬁning and knowing our expectations in
school is no different!
Expectations:anticipated outcomes or standards for a certain situation, person, or behavior.

Expectations in Schools
In schools, expectations are intentionally broad. They are linked to more speciﬁc rules or skills,
which are the tools used to meet expectations. Rules and skills can be set up to support learning,
behavior, and positive health and wellbeing. Speciﬁc rules, skills, and expectations should be
matched to student and staff values, developmental levels, and cultural backgrounds. 
Here are some examples of the most widely used schoolwide social expectations in the United
States (Lynass et al., 2012):
Be respectful
Be responsible
Be safe
Be ready to learn
Care
Work together
Do your best
Be kind
Expectations are the blueprint and Tier 1 supports are speciﬁcs created
to get there. These supports should be accessible to everyone!
Let's listen to Dr. Jake Klipsch, a principal in an
alternative high school, explain how vital expectations
are in education.
Watch from 0:00 to 5:17; don't worry - we will come back for the rest later in this lesson!
The Reality We Create: Expectations and Education | Jake Klipsch ……
The Reality We Create: Expectations and Education | Jake Klipsch 
As you can tell, expectations play a signiﬁcant role within our schools. By proactively creating
and implementing schoolwide expectations about academics, behavior, and positive health and
wellbeing*, provide students and staff with a school climate that is predictable, welcoming, and
respectful.
Positive health and wellbeing refers to the social, emotional, and mental healthiness of a
person.This is the term we, The SBHA, use, but you may be more familiar with the term
"social emotional learning” which you will still see in the outside resources we link! Don’t
worry. Even though the term we use in these lessons is "positive health and wellbeing", the
material shared with “social emotional learning” in it still applies!
We can neither excuse nor scold them for not knowing; we
must teach them and provide support, insistence, and
expectations.
Dr. Ruby K. Payne, Educator and Expert on Poverty and Schooling
Like Dr. Payne said, one cannot assume that students know all our expectations, so you need to
intentionally teach and promote them in such a way that every student can meet them.
Ultimately, schoolwide expectations are a common language of appropriate behaviors and
attitudes for all students and staff to understand. 
In this lesson, you will analyze how to create and implement schoolwide expectations, evaluate
types of expectations within a school, and examine how expectations can be used to build
healthy relationships. First—a knowledge check!

Making Expectations
The "Who" and "How" Behind Creating Expectations
Who Creates Expectations at the School?
Creating and implementing schoolwide expectations is a team effort! Teaming is a core
component of the Multi-tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework.
Your school may have a Tier 1 Leadership Team that creates the schoolwide expectations, or
your school may have a general leadership team that does so. Whether your school has teams
within teams or a couple of larger groups, your schoolwide expectations are ideally co-created
with educators, administrators, families, school health and behavioral health staff, community
partners, and students. Expectations should be a consensus, reﬂecting values shared by your
entire school community.
When possible, the team creating schoolwide expectations will discuss them before the school
year starts and then monitor them throughout the academic year. To protect and promote your
relationships with families, educators, and students especially, use emailed or texted surveys as
a solution to gather suggestions, feedback, and input from families with busy schedules. Focus
groups, whether online or in person, can further the conversation about expectations, from
their creation to their completion. 
Family in a room with a fort in the background
As you learned in Lesson Two, you know family engagement promotes
healthy youth development. When it comes to co-creating schoolwide
expectations, engaging with parents and caregivers ensures that the
expectations are culturally relevant and reﬂect student and family values. It
also prompts discussion about the differences between expectations within
the school and those at home.
Partnering with Students & Families
Students affrm that the more involved they are in creating and implementing expectations, the
more they care about following them (Llyod et al., 2022). 
Here are practical ways you can partner with students and families.
- Surveys asking for household values and input on schoolwide expectations while
drafting expectations
- Emails asking for feedback on schoolwide once a list is created
- Focus groups with students, parents, and caregivers that are held in person or
virtually
- Brainstorming classroom expectations with your students during teh ﬁrst two
weeks of school
- Gathering suggestions from students by using drop boxes throughout classrooms
- Partnering with diverse students, parents, and caregivers in the leadership team responsible for creating and implementing expectations.
When creating expectations with students, do this at the developmentally appropriate level.
Whether creating a song with elementary students about expectations, a TikTok dance with
your middle schoolers, or a straightforward paragraph in response to a prompt with high
schoolers, creating and implementing expectations with students builds relationships and sets
you up for success. 
When brainstorming your schoolwide expectations, use data regarding student outcomes and
behavior, family and student input, and the decisions from the leadership team to create three
to ﬁve schoolwide expectations.
Guidelines for Creating Expectations
As you contemplate creating expectations, it can be helpful to consider the following:
- "What is it we want our students to know and be able to do?"
- "How will we know if each student has learned it?"
- "How will we respond when students do not learn it?"
- "How will we extend learning for students who demonstrated proﬁciency?"
How you answer these questions, asked by Jeremy Phillips (2022; p.56), can be a helpful,
intuitive starting point for determining the expectations you want to have in your schools for
students.
Because expectations are for both students and staff, let's reframe these questions to involve
staff as well.
- How will we ensure our students learn expectations through our teaching and
example?
- What takeaways do we want students to have when we reinforce expectations?
- How will we verify that we are following standards for creating, implementing, and
following expectations?
With these questions in mind, you can create schoolwide expectations with the following
guidelines adapted from Teacher Tool Classroom Expectations and Rules (2017):
Observable
Measurable
Understandable
Always Applicable
Memorable
Positively Stated
Look through the tabs by using the arrows on either side to learn more about each guideline and
see examples as needed!
Observable –
The schoolwide expectations become observable when linked to rules or skills that you can see in
use by students to meet the expectations.
Example: The expectation, “Be Respectful” is observable with the rule or skill, “Raise Your Hand
During Class Before Speaking”.
Measurable –
You should be able to “count” students fulﬁlling rules and skills associated with each expectation.
You can count how many students are following the expectations based on their disciplinary
referrals, the number of students receiving Tier 3 supports, academic outcomes, and so on.
Example: The expectation, “Be Honest” can be measured by the number of students referred to
the offce for disciplinary action regarding cheating or plagiarism. 
Understandable –
Each expectation and its associated rules are tailored to the developmental and cultural
backgrounds of the students they apply to.
Example: In an elementary school, the expectation, “Be Respectful” comes with the rule, “Keep
Your Hands and Feet to Yourself," whereas a high school rule may be, “Be mindful of others'
personal space.” 
Always Applicable –
As you may have noticed, the expectations are a bit vague. This is intentional: the expectations
must be broad enough to cover the varied contexts and situations within a school setting. Having
a broad expectation ensures that it is the standard instead of an exception. 
Example: The expectation "Be Safe" can be contextualized to crosswalks, classrooms,
equipment, and online activity. However, making "Check Signals Before Crossing in the Parking
Lot" an expectation instead of a rule prevents it from applying across other school areas.
Memorable –
It is important for students and staff to recall their school’s expectations. Connecting
expectations to the school motto, mascot, or name can be helpful ways to increase memorability.
Having memorable expectations is another reason why no more than ﬁve expectations are
encouraged. Alliteration can also be helpful!
Example: “Be Ready, Be Responsible, Be Respectful" is an example of alliteration in expectations.
Another example of memorable expectations is “Sutton Hill School’s Star Ways: Be Safe, Be
Thoughtful, Be Aware, Be Respectful”. 
Positively Stated –
Expectations are the standards for what to do, instead of what not to do. This is important: it is
the difference between being proactive with positive behavior, values, and attitudes rather than
being reactivetowards what is unhelpful or disruptive.
Example: A positively stated value is, “Be Trustworthy,” whereas “Don’t Cheat, Don’t Lie, and
Don’t Gossip” are negatively stated expectations. 
You have learned what expectations are, why they're important, and the "how-to" of creating
them practically. After a you take break and pass this knowledge check, move forward to
examine three key types of expectations in the school setting: academic, behavioral, and
positive health and wellbeing.


Academic Expectations
Expectations for Coursework and Classrooms
This is a brief section; after all, you're already familiar with schoolwide academic expectations! 
The South Carolina Department of Education’s standards for learning are your schoolwide
expectations for learning. Attached a link to those standards broken up by subject if you want a
refresher.
Standards & Learning
The Offce of Standards and Learning provides standards development,
supporting documents for standards, and professional learning.
READ MORE SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
Check out an example of academic standards below!
IMAGE HERE
Graphic comparing South Carolina's Standards of Learning for mathematics for
kindergarteners and high schoolers
These expectations are...
- Observable and measurable based on academic performance (e.g., number of students passing, end-of-course grades, etc.)
- Understandable for each developmental and cultural level
- Always applicableto every student in every school
- Positively stated by focusing on what students willlearn rather than what they have not learned or will not
While your school already uses the State standards for academics, you can take it further by
creating school expectations for improvement or effort. Those may be classroom expectations
you make as an educator. If you would like to learn more about taking schoolwide expectations
and adapting them for your speciﬁc classroom, take our Tier 2 course! 
For now, let's move onward to look more in-depth at behavioral expectations before diving into
positive health and wellbeing expectations.

Behavioral Expectations
Expecting the Best Out of Actions
Chances are, you already know a thing or two about behavioral expectations in your school.
Perhaps the most well-known example of schoolwide expectations regarding behavior is
Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Your school may even be using PBIS to set
schoolwide behavioral expectations already. If so, these principles will be helpful refreshers. If
your school does not use PBIS, you will ﬁnd valuable principles that can be applied in your
schools and classrooms! 
While all expectations interact with one another, behavioral expectations are crucial in
establishing a predictable environment wherein the other expectations can ﬂourish.

Practical Steps to Setting Up Schoolwide Behavioral Expectations
To brainstorm schoolwide behavioral expectations, the National PBIS Leadership Forum in 2011
encourages educators to take three to ﬁve schoolwide expectations and attach two to ﬁve
descriptors of speciﬁc, observable behavior that exemplify meeting those expectations in each
speciﬁc school context (e.g., hallway, cafeteria, school drop-off). 
These are the "Turning Cellphones Off while in the Classroom"
rulesthat link back to the "Be Respectful" expectation.
To jumpstart your thought process, ask yourself: "How would a student display being respectful
within the cafeteria? Howcwould they show that they're being safe? What about responsible?"
Teaching matrices are an extremely helpful method of organizing your answers to these
questions and the descriptors you attach to your expectations. A helpful tip is to ﬁll out each
context as a team, but let individual teachers create their own expectations for their speciﬁc
classrooms.
Check out some examples below by clicking on them to
IMAGE HERE

Oklahoma Department of Education that has examples of teaching matrices for elementary,
middle, and high schools!

When thinking through the behaviors you want to emphasize with your behavioral
expectations, review your data. Use the data gathered from offce discipline referrals (ODRs),
teacher and student input, and observations as a team to ﬁnd those areas. 
As you outline the expected behavior, remember to keep your expectations positively stated. For
example, use “Listen to Each Other Without Interrupting” instead of “Don’t Talk Over Each
Other." 
Students learn and internalize the expectations presented by the school through explicit
instruction, reteaching, prompted opportunities to exhibit skills, and modeled behaviors by the
educators themselves. 
The Importance of Contextualizing Behavioral Expectations
In a study of 155 schools across 12 regionally representative US states, Lynass et al. (2012) found
the following behavioral rules to be the most common under the top three most common broad
expectations: respect, responsibility, safety.
TABLE HERE
There is a lot of overlap between behavioral expectations, as well as a lot of ambiguity! You can
click on the Venn diagram to enlarge it if needed.
IMAGE HERE
Venn diagram of three circles: respect, responsibility, and safety
It is important to contextualize your behavioral expectations in that which is culturally and
developmentally relevant to your student body while simultaneously acknowledging that some
expectations may have different meanings for different groups. 
For example, it is common to eat with one’s hands in many cultures. This may not appear as
“neat and clean” to those who are accustomed to using cutlery. These differences don't mean
that one group is “right” and the other is “wrong." When interpreting behavioral expectations
for students, rely on input from families and students, especially those from different cultures
and backgrounds. Creating more detailed deﬁnitions of “Neat and Clean” to broaden staff and
students' awareness can clarify a subjectivity that may contribute to inequity or stigma. 
With a ﬁrmer understanding of behavioral expectations, you're ready to review positive health
and wellbeing expectations after this knowledge check.

Positive Health and Wellbeing Expectations
Supporting Wellbeing Intentionally
It may feel odd to have expectations and subsequent rules for students' and staff's positiv
health and wellbeing. However, as you've already learned, Tier 1 supports are proactive and
preventative. By articulating standards through expectations, you are better able to see when
students are struggling to reach those goals. This, in turn, equips us to determine which
students need additional support from Tier 2 or Tier 3.
Schoolwide expectations for positive health and wellbeing shows
students and staff that youcare about more than just their academics
or behavior, but thatyou care about their whole being as well.
Schoolwide expectations for positive health and wellbeing contribute to our desire for students
to grow, not just academically, but mentally, emotionally, and socially. Schoolwide expectations
for positive health and wellbeing contribute to that growth the same way expectations for
academics and behaviors do. 
Practically Setting Schoolwide Expectations for Positive
Health and Wellbeing
It can feel overwhelming to think through positive health and wellbeing expectations for your
school. Positive health and wellbeing covers a broad spectrum, encompassing mental, social,
and emotional aspects. You will learn more about what this looks like practically in the next
lesson on elevating wellness! For now, the good news is that the state of South Carolina already
outlined ﬁve core areas of positive health and wellbeing in its Proﬁle of a South Carolina
graduate! These are based in the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning
(CASEL).
Self-Awareness
Social Awareness
Self-Management
Relationship Skills
Responsible Decision Making

Positive Health and Wellbeing
What competencies in positive health and wellbeing should a South Carolina graduate
possess?
Step 1
Self-Awareness
Recognizing one's emotions, thoughts, and values; knowing one's strengths and
limitations; grounded self-conﬁdence; a "growth" mindset
Step 2
Social Awareness
Taking the perspective of and empathizing with others, including those who are
different from oneself; understanding social norms in different settings; recognizing
supports in one's school, family, and community for behavior and attitudes
Step 3
Self-Management
Regulating one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in any situation; managing
impulses, self-motivation to set, work towards, and accomplish goals
Step 4
Relationship Skills
Establishing and maintaining healthy, mutually fulﬁlling relationships with people
of all backgrounds; communicating clearly; navigating conﬂict; being ﬁrm against
inappropriate peer pressure
Step 5
Responsible Decision Making
Making constructive choices about one's behavior and interactions based on ethical
standards, one's values, and social norms; evaluating consequences of an action and
making decisions with that in mind
Summary
Throughout all ﬁve competencies, students are learning to advocate for themselves
and others while further understanding their own identity, strengths and limitations,
and live a life in line with their values and goals.

Creating rules or skills based on expectations for positive health and wellbeing may feel like the
most challenging out of the three kinds of expectations. In many ways, it is easier to measure
students meeting the expectation of “Be Safe” by properly and safely handling equipment in the
science lab than it is to measure students being safe by not caving-in to inappropriate peer
pressure. 
Practically, setting schoolwide expectations for positive health and wellbeing is done through
curricula, but don't worry. You’re not alone in the process of drafting curriculum for schoolwide
expectations for positive health and wellbeing. Not only do you have your team, but you also
have the rich curricula recognized by South Carolina’s Department of Education! 
While you’ll learn more about speciﬁc lessons, activities, or exercises to use for positive health
and wellbeing in both the upcoming lesson on wellness and in Tier 2, the curriculum and tools
you decide on ahead of time is foundational. Let’s review three of those now, one for each
school level!

Positive Health and Wellbeing Resources
First 20 Days of School for 3rd and 4th Grade Elementary Students
A method for setting schoolwide expectations for positive health and wellbeing can be to
implement speciﬁc lessons regarding each area of competency. An example of this is the
curriculum developed by the South Carolina Department of Education for 3rd and 4th graders'
ﬁrst 20 days back in school.
Lesson plans with speciﬁc activities are developed for each of the 20 days. The lesson plans are
allocated across competency areas, and include instructions, resources, and reﬂection
opportunities. You will cover methods teachers can use to adapt lesson plans for their speciﬁc
classrooms in Tier 2, but it is important to ground the lesson plans in the previously decided
upon curriculum to ensure consistency across the principles being taught. 
Here are a few examples of lesson plans that revolve around interactive reading activities!
I'M  ALL EARS: This reading activity focuses on teaching students relationship-management skills. The teacher
reads Howard B. Wigglebottom Learns to Listen, and pauses throughout to discuss what happens
when Howard does or does not listen. Recommendations to make the reading more tangible
include creating a cause-and-effect chart of what happens when Howard doesn't listen compared
to when he does. Students are then encouraged to talk about a time when they didn't listen and
what the outcome was, and talk about strategies they can use to listen to one another in the
classroom.
SAME BUT DIFFERENT:This activity focuses on expanding students' social awareness. South Carolina's Department of
Education recommends different books for this, includingSkin Like Mineby Latashia Perry or
Same, Same But Differentby Jenny Sue Kostecki-Shaw. The teacher leads a discussion about
people from different cultures, backgrounds, and abilities. Students can discuss or journal about
where they are from and what they like to do and can be grouped into pairs or smaller groups to
discuss how they are similar and different.
MANAGING EMOTIONS:Students learn more about self-management in this activity where the teacher reads When Sophie
Gets Angry...Really, Really Angry....by Molly Bang. The goal of reading about emotions is to teach
students how to name emotions as well as how to manage them so that they don't hurt themselves
or other people. Teachers can display other emotion words for "anger" and ask students how they
physically feel when they're angry. Students can then write about how they can manage anger in
different settings, like the home, school, or a friend's house. In groups, students can discuss a
time they were angry, what prompted it, and how they managed it.

Character Playbook for Middle Schoolers
Districts in South Carolina, along with CASEL, have partnered with EVERFI for many years. Your
own district may be using EVERFI already! EVERFI offers 20 free courses designed for students
on a multitude of different positive health and wellbeing topics for middle and high schoolers. It
also includes courses on ﬁnancial literacy.
One of the courses for middle schoolers is called, "Character Playbook".
EVERFI
Character Playbook - Healthy Relationships | EVERFI
Character Playbook is an innovative digital character education program that
uses engaging social-emotional learning activities to educate students about
cultivating and maintaining healthy relationships during their critical middle
school and high school years. Character Playbook is composed of ﬁve modules
that cover key concepts around positive character development, social-
emotional learning (SEL), and building healthy relationships, based on the
CASEL standards for SEL.

This two hour course involves a digital character education program where students work
through real life scenarios. Students go through the key concepts previously mentioned: self-
awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship skills, and responsible decision
making!
See the images from EVREFI's website that showcase some of the scenarios students work
through!

Understanding Mental Wellness for High Schoolers

For high school students, courses regarding positive health and wellbeing can go more in depth
than younger grades to match their developmental level. South Carolina's Department of
Education puts EVERFI courses at the forefront of its recommendations. Here's a review of one
of their courses, “Understanding Mental Wellness”!
EVERFI
Understanding Mental Wellness | EVERFI
Like our physical health, our mental health can be strengthened or diminished
through daily habits. Understanding Mental Wellness introduces students to
the topic of mental health and the ways in which they can implement coping
strategies to manage their own challenging thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
READ MORE EVERFI 
This holds six lessons that take a total of an hour to an hour and a half. Students learn key
deﬁnitions, coping strategies, and how to offer and seek help. In the next lesson, you will learn
more about mental wellness yourself, as well as strategies to use with students!
PBIS and Positive Health and Wellbeing
While PBIS focuses primarily on behavior, its structure and resources can be adapted to creating
and implementing schoolwide expectations for positive health and wellbeing! PBIS even
encourages this itself (PBIS, 2018).
Since PBIS is a form of MTSS, using PBIS to create schoolwide expectations about positive
health and wellbeing involves doing what you’re already doing—relying on data to see what
competencies need extra teaching and working within your team! The extra step is applying the
competencies you want to emphasize in your schools to the PBIS matrix.
Similar to specifying behavioral descriptors under each value per school context, describe
activities or attitudes students can demonstrate for each positive health and wellbeing
competency. See the image below for an example; if you need to enlarge it, just click on it!
TABLE HERE
Table of positive health and Wellbeing; Rules are in Italics and Outlined
As with behavior, showing students positive health and wellbeing expectations involves explicit
instruction, reteaching throughout the year, providing opportunities to practice, and modeling
the expectations oneself. In the lesson on enhancing wellness, you’ll learn more practical steps
to enhance and maintain your and your students' positive health and wellbeing! 
Positive Health and Wellbeing for Families and
Caregivers
When building schoolwide expectations for positive health and wellbeing, it is important to
partner with families to decide the skills that are especially needed within the student body and
how schools can support practices in the home and vice versa. This communicates that the
school cares about more than just academics, ultimately contributing to a foundational
relationship between the families and schools. This supports students' wellbeing through all
tiers!
General Resources
As we acknowledged earlier, creating expectations for positive health and wellbeing is not easy.
It is distinct from academic and behavioral expectations in that it is harder to quantify or
materialize what positive health and wellbeing actually looks like. Here, we've gathered
resources for you to analyze and consider, whether as a jumping off point or for your end goal.

Instructions
"EVERFI is an invaluable resource for our students as a method for engaging
instruction because of its relevant and authentic application to students' lives.
Students grow as a result of this program in extremely positive ways - both in
their understanding of ﬁnancial literacy and their interest in the subject
matter."

Implementing Expectations
Putting the Expectations into Place
You’ve done the work. You met with your team, examined data, coordinated with parents, spoke
to students, drafted your expectations matrices, and decided upon your positive health and
wellbeing lesson plans—now what? 
Implementing expectations starts with visibility.
It is important for students and staff to see what the expectations are in each context. This can
be done by using posters of your matrices in the appropriate contexts. This is a great
opportunity to involve students! Have younger students craft posters using markers, glitter, and
other fun tools! Alternatively, get a stuffed animal that matches your mascot and let students
take it home each weekend and discuss how the mascot implemented school values at home.
Older students can create videos discussing one particular expectation or rule that is played
during morning announcements, or even create a website or web content that is posted
through the school’s own homepage. 

As mentioned before, students need time to learn expectations. You can take the ﬁrst two weeks
of an academic year and focus on teaching students in your classroom the expectations and the
speciﬁc actions to follow them. This can be done differently at each developmental level:
elementary age students may need more deﬁnitions, examples and non-examples, and memory
refreshers while high schoolers may do well with a section in the syllabus dedicated to
expectations and a quiz on it during their ﬁrst week. Reviewing expectations after winter break
is another preventive strategy to ensure that expectations are not just seen but understood!
Benchmarks of Quality and Expectations
To assess your school’s creation and implementation of expectations, you can use the
Benchmarks of Quality assessment. While the Benchmarks of Quality goes over vital elements
PBIS implementation, you can use the section on expectations to assess how your school is
creating and implementing them! Here is a brief overview of relevant critical elements of the
Benchmarks of Quality:
TABLE HERE
You can use these guidelines as goalposts when developing and implementing expectations.
Once expectations are created and in place, how do you respond to students when expectations
are met or unmet? You’ll learn more in the very next section! 

Responding to Expectations Through Relationships
How Students Are Reinforced
Knowing how to respond when students meet our expectations and follow the rules, or when
they don’t, can be tricky. Reinforcements are important; they can encourage forming positive
habits or prevent ineffective or unhelpful behaviors from becoming routine. Reinforcements are
needed in everyday life, including school, but understanding how to implement them, however,
is less straight-forward. 
This tension is demonstrated clearly in how teachers' and students' perceive a common form
of reinforcement through PBIS (Llyod et al., 2022; Tidewell, 2022). 
Read through how teachers and students feel about reinforcement systems in the graphic
below! You can enlarge it by clicking on it.
IMAGE HERE
Graphic of students' and teachers' view on reinforcement systems in the classroom
As you can see, the pros or cons of reinforcing through rewards, “cash,” or tokens are divided.
Some of these issues can be tackled, such as ensuring well-rounded, deﬁned training for
teachers on behaviors and attitudes to reward or involving students more closely in the process.
However, this does not address students’ and staff’s motivation to engage in the system, or
how reinforcement can matter to all students. 
There are no easy answers on implementing reinforcements. Nevertheless, there are key
principles to keep in mind that can lessen the diffculties associated with reinforcement
systems. 

Reinforcing Through Relationship
All reinforcements require relationship. Think back on a time in your life when someone, maybe
a parent, teacher, or boss, either corrected or commended your behavior or work. What
difference did the closeness, trust, and respect you had for that person make in how you
perceived their response? If you didn't know the person, their response was most likely just a
nice affrmation or a pesky admonishment. It takes relationship for reinforcements to stick or
to matter.
If your students do not know that they are cared for as people,
regardless of behavior or attitudes, then reinforcements, whether
tangible or verbal, will not impact their motivation and character.
Within schoolwide expectations, what matters in reinforcement is the person responding, not
necessarily the reinforcement itself. Build your relationships with your students so that when
reinforcement or intervention occurs, it matters. A way to build relationships with students can
occur through “5 Minute Chats with Students” from CASEL. 

Keeping Reinforcements Clear
The deﬁnitions for misconduct, reinforcement, and intervention ought to be clearly deﬁned
and well known by staffs and students. An example of a well-outlined dictionary of misconduct
and intervention is found in the attached Behavioral Standards from a school district in
California.
For example, hazing is deﬁned as:
"Any method of initiation into a student organization or group that causes or may cause
physical harm or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to
a student."
One of the outlined responses to hazing, as a minimum standard, is an informal conference.
This is clearly deﬁned as:
"A school offfcial (teacher, administrator or counselor) will meet with the student for
instruction & guidance providing reteaching and corrective feedback. This may offer the
student an opportunity to have an understanding of, and be motivated to change, his or
her behavior. A student so involved is more likely to become re-engaged in the process of
learning."
There are multiple examples in the document below that you can use as tools to think through
how you deﬁne behaviors and reactions in your own school.
Having such clear deﬁnitions prevents ambiguity when making decisions about responding to
students. A helpful tool your school may already have, or you can create within your leadership
team is a chart that connects speciﬁc types of misconduct with appropriate responses based on
the action, its severity, ﬁrst time occurrence, or repeated instances.

Equity in Responses
Racial minority students, especially Black students, face far more offce discipline referrals than
their peers. To work against this inequity, data regarding disciplinary action should be
disaggregated by race, gender, ethnicity, and disability to monitor trends. Having clearly deﬁned
expectations for behavior and clearly deﬁned procedures for misconduct further pushes against
bias in disciplinary actions.
For more tips, see the attached 5-Point Intervention Approach for Enhancing Equity in School
Discipline from PBIS. You can ﬁnd additional material on disproportionality in the Core MTSS
Course.
You have covered a broad but important topic in this lesson. The expectations in schools provide
structure for learning to ﬂourish and relationships to grow in a predictable, safe, and
welcoming environment. Let’s return to Dr. Jake Klipsch (See? We did come back to him!) to
hear how you can respond to this new information. 
Academic, behavioral, and positive health and wellbeing
expectations are important because they encompass
distinct parts of our students that collectively create the
whole person.
Creating and implementing schoolwide expectations in Tier 1 is a journey instead of a
destination. It is important that you have a team working alongside you. 

Let's review the lesson.
- Expectations for students and staff are important because they give everyone a
common language to use about academics, behavior, and positive health and
wellbeing.
- Academic expectations are set by South Carolina's Department of Education, while
behavioral and positive health and wellbeing expectations are set by teams within
your school and district.
- Behavioral expectations are three to ﬁve positively stated expectations that have
associated, context-speciﬁc rules.
- Positive health and wellbeing expectations are rooted in curricula and lesson plans
to implement in your school.
- When responding to students who meet or don't meet expectations, focus on the
relationship ﬁrst, have clearly deﬁned responses, and ensure that equity is the
priority.

What is Wellness?
Examining Wellness in the School Setting
A white building with many windows and balconies
Wellness is the act of practicing healthy habits on a daily basis to attain better physical and
mental outcomes. It is the active pursuit of activities, choices, and lifestyles that lead to a state of
holistic health—wellness is not just surviving; it means thriving. 
School wellness is an approach that actively supports the physical, mental, social, and
emotional health of everyone in the school community.
A healthy school has a culture and environment where the importance of health and overall
wellness is visible on the walls and in every classroom—the importance of overall wellness is
supported and promoted in all aspects of the school.
At the Tier 1 level, promoting wellness for all provides a strong foundation to continue building
on.

Components of Educator Wellness
Wellness is important for both educators and students. In this lesson, you will focus on
wellness for educators: teachers, administrators, mental health clinicians, and any other staff
working in a school.
Educator wellness is about the combination of our love for what we do each day, the quality of
our relationships, the security of our ﬁnances, the vibrancy of our physical health, and the pride
we take in what we have contributed to our communities (Rath & Harter, 2014). Most
importantly, it’s about how these dimensions interact.
Click through the images below for more information
about the eight dimensions of educator wellness.

Dimensions of Educator Wellness
Educator wellness can be deﬁned along eight dimensions described by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): emotional,
environmental, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, occupational, and ﬁnancial.
Dimension 1
Emotional
Emotional wellness is the ability to successfully handle life's stresses and adapt to
change and diffcult times (National Institutes of Health, 2022).
Individuals who are emotionally well experience fewer negative emotions and bounce
back from diffculties faster. This quality is called resilience.
Emotional wellness is of major importance in an educator’s daily life because it
affects interactions with students, parents, colleagues, and administrators.
Educators can achieve emotional management and wellness through individual
activities that allow for self-reﬂection and processing as well as maintaining
connections with friends who are active listeners, trusted colleagues, mentors,
coaches, or professionals who are trained in emotional wellness strategies.
Counseling can give the educator a safe space with a neutral party to make sense of
emotions and gain clarity on how to make necessary life adjustments.
Dimension 2
Physical
Educators often feel so extended by the day-to-day demands of their professional
and personal lives that they don’t make time for physical wellness. Educators who
have a depleted sense of physical wellness are more susceptible to physical and
mental illness, which has a direct inﬂuence on attendance, relationships, and capacity
to serve students. In turn, this can have a negative impact on other educators and their
ability to serve students.
Dimension 3
Intellectual
Just like your physical and emotional health, your intellect needs nourishment too!
Intellectual wellbeing is a sense of curiosity, being open to new ideas, thinking
critically, and being an overall lifelong learner. The pursuit of one’s intellectual
passion is essential for educators’ relational and instructional engagement with
students. It helps them stay current with evolving research and follow through with
emerging best practices.
Dimension 4
Environmental
Environmental wellness establishes the physical and mental foundation that grounds
an educator’s work, including the physical and emotional environment. Contributors
to environmental wellness in the school setting include the safety and upkeep of the
building, the culture of staff and students, and the sustainability of practices.
Dimension 5
Social
Social wellness refers to developing a sense of connection, belonging, and a well-
developed support system.
Positive social habits help us build support systems and stay healthier mentally and
physically.
Social wellness provides educators with the foundation for interaction and
participation with and commitment to students, parents, and the community that is
rooted in mutual respect, interdependence, and cooperation (Sackney et al., 2000;
Strout & Howard, 2012).
Dimension 6
Spiritual
Spiritual wellness represents personal beliefs and values and involves having a
purpose and a sense of balance and peace. Spiritual wellness allows educators to ﬁnd
their purpose and passion within the profession, enabling them to serve students
equitably. Spiritual wellness is unique to each individual in how they will cultivate the
understanding to support this dimension. Educators can create the space for
deepening their spiritual wellness by examining individual aspirations and analyzing
recurring patterns through reﬂective journaling, meditation, and introspective
mindfulness.
Dimension 7
Occupational
Occupational wellness includes job satisfaction, the ability to use your talents and
skills at work, and your ambitions for professional growth and change. People with
occupational wellness ﬁnd their work rewarding, have good relationships with co-
workers, and ﬁnd positive ways to handle workplace stress, all while also ﬁnding a
good work-life balance.
Dimension 8
Financial
Financial wellness has a direct effect on educators’ ability to support their life, health,
and mental wellbeing. If an individual is under ﬁnancial stress, this occupies an
overwhelming amount of an individual’s mental capacity, preventing educators from
being fully mindful and critically conscious in their instructional practices and
relationships.

Why is a more intentional focus on school wellness so
important?
Airplane window view
Often, educators put students and families ﬁrst. As educators, after all, the goal is to support
students as much as we can. Sometimes, self-care can feel like it's taking away time from taking
care of others, and it can even feel selﬁsh.
However, personal wellness is needed in order to effectively help others. You may be familiar
with the metaphor of ﬂying on an airplane and being told to put on your oxygen mask ﬁrst
before helping others. This is because if your oxygen mask isn't on, you will be unable to
breathe and provide support to anyone else. You may also be familiar with the phrase "you
cannot pour from an empty cup." Similarly, we cannot be fully present and giving to others if we
are running on empty.
The same concept is true in the school setting: wellness helps educators perform roles more
effectively, ﬁnd more satisfaction at work, and create a positive environment, improving the
experience for educators and students alike.

Barriers to Educator Wellness
While we often acknowledge the importance of wellness, maintaining it is not always easy.
There are many barriers to wellness that professionals in the school setting experience.
According to several studies and reports, teaching is a highly stressful job. For example, the
American Federation of Teachers’ 2017 Educator Quality of Work Life Survey found that 61% of
teachers said their jobs were always or often stressful—more than double the rate of non-
teaching working adults—and 58% said they had poor mental health due to stress levels. That
was before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
In another study, researchers conducted surveys in January 2022 with public school teachers,
principals, and working adults, asking about the following ﬁve aspects of wellbeing:  
- Frequent job-related stress
- Ability to cope with job-related stress
- Burnout, symptoms of depression
- Resilience to stressful events
The image below depicts the results from the survey. Click to enlarge.
IMAGE HERE
A chart depicting wellbeing survey results
As can be seen from the chart, compared to other working adults, teachers and principals
reported experiencing greater rates of frequent job-related stress, burnout, symptoms of
depression, and not coping well with job-related stress: almost 75% of teachers and 85% of
principals experience frequent job-related stress, compared to 35% of other working adults
(Rand Corp, 2022). Meanwhile, compared to teachers and principals, other working adults
reported experiencing higher resilience.

Resilience:the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difffcult or challenging life
experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral ffexibility and
adjustment to external and internal demands (American Psychological Association, 2023).
A number of factors contribute to how well people adapt to adversities, predominant
among them:
the ways in which individuals view and engage with the world
the availability and quality of social resources
speciffc coping strategies
What’s going on? Why are educators experiencing such diffculties with their occupation?
Educators love what they do, but some are ﬁnding it harder and harder to "bounce back" from
so many demanding and stressful events. Let's take a closer look at major underlying issues.
“Teaching never stops, says Samantha T., a special
education teacher in West Virginia. "I don’t recall the last
time I got a full lunch break—without behavior check-
ins, a parent phone call, or the extra coverage needed due
to lack of subs. Instead of planning periods, when the bell
rings at 3:30, and students go home, my grading and
planning work is far from ﬁnished”
- NEA.com, 2022

Educators report that their stress is often related to increased job demands—especially around:
- testing and assessments
- challenging student behaviors
- a lack of decision-making power
- insuffcient professional development in social and emotional learning
to support students' needs
These factors, along with other various concerns, can lead to secondary traumatic stress (STS),
burnout, and compassion fatigue. Let's review more about these challenges to wellness in the
tabs below.
Secondary traumatic stress: Secondary traumatic stress (STS) is the emotional distress that results when an individual hears
about the traumatic experiences of another individual. Distress may result from hearing
someone’s trauma stories, seeing high levels of distress in the aftermath of a traumatic event,
retelling a traumatized person's story, and/or seeing photos or images related to the trauma.
Common symptoms of STS include the following (click on image to enlarge):
Burnout: Burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion and a sense of reduced personal
accomplishment. Burnout has similar symptoms to STS, but can result from other stressors
besides trauma exposure, like feeling overloaded with responsibilities, not having enough time, or
not having enough resources. Click on the image below to enlarge and see warning signs of
educator burnout out.
IMAGE HERE
Compassion Fatigue: A combination of STS and burnout can result in compassion fatigue. Compassion fatigue refers
to occupational exhaustion and stress that results from absorbing the trauma and emotions
associated with helping others. Compassion fatigue can make it diffcult to continue empathizing
with others, cause physical symptoms, and increase the risk of developing mental health
disorders. Review the symptoms of compassion fatigue in the graphic below. Click to enlarge.

How to Support Educator Wellness: Shared Responsibility
Teacher burnout is a problem that can be addressed at the individual and district/school
leadership levels. At the individual level, there’s a range of things that you can do to improve
your own wellbeing, called self-care. Self-care often is, and should be, encouraged: it is
important to consider your own wellbeing and take steps to actively support it. We will review
strategies for self-care later in the lesson. 
However, self-care alone is often not enough to overcome the many challenges faced in the
school setting, many of which may be out of the control of individual educators. It is important
to acknowledge that the responsibility is not solely on educators; self-care may feel like yet
another burden or task to complete. Leadership, both at the district and school levels, plays a
large role in creating environments that impact the wellness of faculty, staff, and students. For
example, decisions about funding allocation, classroom sizes, school policies, and much more
can make a signiﬁcant impact on the school environment and the rate of burnout that teachers
experience.
Because of this, there is a shared responsibility between educators and school leadership in
promoting educator wellness. Leadership can promote policies that facilitate wellness, and
individual educators can take action to support their wellbeing. 
Brandi explains that districts and schools have a responsibility to examine organizational
systems, practices, and policies to identify and organize resources in ways that effectively
promote educator wellness. While individual educators and schools can both make steps
forward in promoting wellness, it is essential that this is done together so that needs are being
appropriately met.
Review the image below for examples of roles that
districts/schools and individuals can play in promoting
wellness.

Best Practices to Support Educator Wellness
Integrating Tier 1 Support at the School Leadership Level
Let's look at teacher wellbeing strategies through an MTSS lens. Your school is already (or is
about to be) invested in MTSS and PBIS to address the academic social, emotional, and
behavioral needs of all students. The PBIS framework also offers an approach to implementing
tiered supports for staff. PBIS promotes a proactive, preventative approach by emphasizing the
use of a continuum of evidence-based social, emotional, and mental health supports. Teams
addressing the mental health and social emotional, and behavioral needs of their students
might also address and support the needs of their staff.
Through this MTSS rationale and the implementation process below, districts can support staff
with varying challenges and needs.
IMAGE HERE
Wellness plan and six-step process

MTSS Action Plan
Using MTSS for educator wellness includes three keyshifts in strategy, collaboration, and data.
1. Shift in Strategy: Focus on universal prevention to promote wellness for all.Start with small,
practical goals and action plan steps that are attainable and make a big impact on overall
wellness 
2. Shift Collaboration: Leadership teams meet regularly and use data and the MTSS to organize
systems, practices, and data enhancements to prioritize wellness for educators and students.
3. Shift in Data Use in Decision-Making: Use large data sets (aggregate) at the universal level to
guide implementation decisions, and make sure the team has appropriate data to promote
wellness for educators and students. Universal data from surveys and focus groups will guide
teams to identify staff needs and develop systems of support.
Universal indicators of wellness include the percentage of staff who feel like they: 
- are connected (within grade level/team and/or school level) 
- are managing their changing role 
- have skills to manage student needs
- can manage their current workload 
- have a voice at the table with school, district, state
are appreciated by students, families, administration, central offce
Seeking Feedback
Feedback is a great way to identify opportunities to provide immediate and future support. To get
educator feedback,a systematicteacher and staff assessment process can help districts and
schools identify areas to improve wellness and reduce stress to ultimately promote success for
all.
Within the MTSS, districts can do these ﬁve things:
1. Establish a clear process and system for collecting, analyzing, and storing data 
2. Conduct wellbeing assessments with teachers and all school staff 
3. Assess staff wellbeing regularly(at least annually)
4. Ensure privacy of information and anonymity when assessing staff wellbeing
5. Assess a range of wellbeing components that address each of the eight dimensions
of wellness

Districts can obtain valuable insight into educator needs by using one-on-one interviews
and/or:
School-Based Surveys –
When using scale-based surveys, select a measurement tool that is valid and reliable and that is
connected to the outcomes you are striving to measure. For example, some tools speciﬁcally
measure things like work-related stress levels, and some tools may focus on other aspects of
wellbeing, like connectedness and teacher effcacy. Examples of tools to measure work-related
dimensions are listed below and include links to the websites.
1. Resilience at Work Scale(RAW), is a 25-item scale intended to capture “resilience
promoting” behaviors and measure the way individuals manage the pressures of work
(Winwood et al., 2013). RAW measures seven aspects of workplace resilience (which are
teachable) and helps to expand opportunities to provide support and nurture employee
resilience.
2. Professional Quality of Life (PROQOL): Includes 30 items to assess compassion satisfaction
and fatigue. Click here for the free complete questionnaire.
3. Health-Related Quality of Life:Developed by the CDC, the HRQOL has 4 questions in the
Healthy Days Core Module and 10 additional questions about activity limitations and healthy
days symptoms. HRQOL is an individual’s or a group’s perceived physical and mental health
over time.
4. Teacher Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire: The Teacher Subjective Wellbeing
Questionnaire is an 8-item self-report rating scales for measuring teachers' job-speciﬁc
wellbeing. It's comprised of two subscales: (1) School Connectedness and (2) Teaching
Effcacy. Subscale scores can be used a standalone wellbeing indicators or summed to create
an Overall Teacher Subjective Wellbeing composite score.

Focus Groups –
A focus group is an information-gathering tool where a selected group of 6-12 people have a
focused discussion on a particular topic. This discussion is guided by a school staff member
acting as a facilitator who asks up to 12 questions. The discussion lasts for 40–80 minutes. A
record keeper documents issues and views raised. School policy regarding data protection should
be adhered to when recording discussions. Generally focus groups meet once only. 

Using measurement tools, schools and districts can build an understanding of teachers'
professional experiences in a number of areas. By gathering educator perceptions of their
wellness, schools can assess the quality of the work environment and develop targeted
programs and professional development that address wellbeing and job satisfaction.
Review the graphic below for components of the teacher
experiences that these surveys may measure.
IMAGE HERE
Graphic listing areas that can be measured to help schools and districts understand
teacher experiences

When districts and school systems engage in the educator wellness assessment processes it is
important to remember these key facts:
- There is no one right way to measure wellness. Use what you know about your context to inform your choice.
- Your resources will affect how often you measure.
- Each measure should be focused on an aspect of wellbeing that you can inﬂuence through interventions.
- Be prepared to act on what you learn.
- Use results from multiple measures to get as much information as possible.
Also, when using a tool, such as a survey or interview protocol, communicate a clear goal to
participants, share how results may be used, and provide a process for protecting
conﬁdentiality. These practices may increase participant trust and willingness to share their
experiences. And as a reminder:
- Consider the purpose of each measure
- Choose a tool that is considerate of your workplace and community culture
- Align staff wellness improvement efforts with needs identiﬁed by your staff wellbeing assessment
- Integrate wellness activities into the school culture instead of after-school activities
When conducting wellbeing assessments, districts must consider the goal, scale, and length of
the survey during the planning process. Open communication with educators and diligent
collection of data on teachers’ professional concerns allows school and district leaders to more
accurately identify and address the root causes of teachers’ stress and dissatisfaction.

dimensions, and an accompanying glossary, download the PDF titled "Wellbeing Measures."

TAKE A LOOK

Taking Action: Applying Educator Feedback
Once data is collected, schools and districts have many options for wellness initiatives. There
are a variety of options to choose from, so it is essential to tie practices back to the input of
educators and what will best serve the needs of each speciﬁc community. In this section, we will
review some of these options.
Wellness Rooms
An example of a school-basedwellness room for staff and students.
Wellness roomsprovide a calming and restorative space for teachers and staff to practice
mindfulness and self-care during breaks. Ideally, these rooms remove offce equipment or
work-related supplies and foster community building, healthy eating, and relaxation. For
example, wellness rooms may include a large table to encourage staff to eat together and
converse or a wall of photos highlighting staff engaging in group outings and healthy activities.
It should be noted that some teachers disagree with creating wellness rooms and believe they
send negative messages (e.g., teaching is so stressful and taxing that teachers need a
therapeutic space to perform their job). Click here to read about one company that supports the
design of educator wellness rooms.

Mindfulness-Based Interventions and Professional Development (PD)
Mindfulness-based interventions and PD effectively reduce stress and teacher burnout by
developing staff members’ mental health tools and practices.
Providing opportunities for professional development in mindfulness is a great way districts can
support educator wellness.
Below are three mindfulness-based professional development programs that demonstrate
effectiveness in supporting educator wellness: Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in
Education (CARE), Community Approach to Learning Mindfully (CALM), and Stress
Management and Relaxation Techniques (SMART) in Education.
Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE). CARE is a 3-4-day professional
development program that helps teachers handle the stresses and rediscover the joys of
teaching. CARE offers teachers and administrators tools and resources for reducing stress,
preventing burnout, enlivening teaching and helping students thrive socially, emotionally and
academically. This program has been carefully studied in a series of randomized trials showing
its effectiveness in boosting teacher’s mental capacities, performance, and social and emotional
functioning which results in more rewarding personal and professional experiences.
CARE can be provided:
- face-to-face at local school districts (a series of days across the school year)
- as a series of shorter workshops across the school year.
- yearly at the Garrison Institute (a four-day retreat model).
CARE can be tailored to the needs of your school or district.
Community Approach to Learning Mindfully (CALM). CALM is an evidence-based program that
provides space and time to support educators daily wellbeing mindfully. Educators are trained to
engage in daily CALM sessions before the school day begins that last about 20 minutes and
provide intentional breathing practices, gentle yoga movement, mindful awareness practices,
and setting positive intentions for the teaching day. CALM was associated with improvements in
mindfulness, emotional functioning, positive affect, distress tolerance, blood pressure, cortisol,
and effcacy in classroom management (Harris, et al., 2016).
Stress Management and Relaxation Techniques in Education (SMART). SMART focuses on
supporting the mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing of educators through the cultivation
of emotional competencies, self-compassion, and mindfulness. The 20-hour evidence-based
personal renewal program is designed especially for adults working in ECE-12 education. Over
ten weeks, participants attend two-hour weekly sessions that include presentations,
discussion, and experiential activities involving movement, emotional awareness, and
meditation. Educators who have completed the program reported decreased stress, anxiety,
depression and burnout, and increased working memory capacity, greater mindfulness and
levels of self-compassion, and more focused attention (Roeser, et al., 2013).
Teachers can improve communication, classroom management, and student learning by
expanding and implementing mindfulness practice through these or other training programs.

Wellness Groups
Cohorts of wellness groups support teacher and staff mental health through peer consultation
groups and group therapy interventions. Districts may support wellness groups by matching
each group with a third-party facilitator or having a staff member receive training to lead
conversations. For example:
Happy Teacher Revolutionsupports the mental health and wellness of teachers. They provide
training to initiate teacher support group meetings in communities around the country. During
these optional group meetings, participants may practice mindfulness, eat healthy meals
together, engage in physical activities or sports, or discuss successes, challenges, and
experiences. The resource also helps districts provide group therapy opportunities for staff interested
in more structured Tier 2 support.

Self-Care and Beyond
Individual Strategies for Improving Wellness
Now that we have reviewed the school/district level initiatives for improving wellness, let's
discuss some strategies that educators can apply to improve their personal wellness. When
reviewing these strategies, it is important to note that not every strategy will work for every
person–resources, schedules, and personal needs make a signiﬁcant difference in what
approaches will work best. Make sure to individualize your own personal wellness plan based on
your own strengths, resources, and needs!
Emotional Intelligence as a Tool for Wellness
Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to
understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress,
communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges, and defuse conﬂict.
Emotional intelligence can help promote wellness by positively impacting relationships with
others, effectiveness at work, awareness of and management of emotions, and overall
wellbeing. Understanding emotional intelligence, and working to improve skills, can help
address some challenges in the school setting.
According to Daniel Goleman, an American psychologist
and author of the groundbreaking book, “Emotional
Intelligence,” (sometimes referred to as EI or EQ) has ffve
key elements:
Self-Awareness-The ability to recognize and understand your own emotions is a critical part of emotional
intelligence. Beyond just recognizing your emotions, however, is being aware of the effect of
your actions, moods, and emotions on other people. To become self-aware, you must be
capable of monitoring your own emotions, recognizing different emotional reactions, and
then correctly identifying each particular emotion. Self-aware individuals also recognize the
relationships between the things they feel and how they behave.
Self-Regulation-This is the ability to regulate and manage your emotions, which is not to say you are putting
emotions on lockdown and hiding your true feelings. It simply means waiting for the right
time and place to express them. Self-regulation is all about expressing your emotions
appropriately. Those who are skilled in self-regulation tend to be ﬂexible and adapt well to
change. They are also good at managing conﬂict and diffusing tense or diffcult situations.
Motivation-Intrinsic motivation also plays a key role in emotional intelligence. People who are
emotionally intelligent are motivated by things beyond external rewards like fame, money,
recognition, and acclaim. Instead, they have a passion to fulﬁll their own inner needs and
goals. They seek internal rewards, experience ﬂow from being totally in tune with an activity
and pursue peak experiences.
Empathy-Being empathetic—or having the ability to understand how others are feeling—is absolutely
crucial to emotional intelligence. But it involves more than just being able to recognize the
emotional states of others. It also involves your responses to people based on this
information. When you sense that someone is feeling bad, depressed, or disheartened, how
do you respond? You might treat them with extra care and concern, or you might try to lift
their spirits.
Social Skills-Being able to interact well with others is another important aspect of emotional intelligence.
True emotional understanding involves more than just consideration of your own emotions
and those of others. You also need to be able to put this information to work in your daily
interactions and communications. In professional settings, managers beneﬁt by being able
to build relationships and connections with employees. Workers beneﬁt from being able to
develop a strong rapport with leaders and co-workers. Important social skills include active
listening, verbal communication skills, nonverbal communication skills, leadership, and
persuasiveness.
Remember, emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed in your
workplace, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your
feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to
you. Emotional intelligence affects:
1. Your performance at work.High emotional intelligence can
help you navigate the social complexities of the workplace,
lead and motivate others, and excel in your career.
Your physical health. If you're unable to manage your emotions, you are probably
not managing your stress either. This can lead to serious health problems.
Uncontrolled stress raises blood pressure, suppresses the immune system,
increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, contributes to infertility, and speeds
up the aging process. The ﬁrst step to improving emotional intelligence is to learn
how to manage stress.
2. Your mental health. Uncontrolled emotions and stress can also impact your mental
health, making you vulnerable to anxiety and depression. If you are unable to
understand, get comfortable with, or manage your emotions, you'll also struggle to
form strong relationships. This in turn can leave you feeling lonely and isolated and
further exacerbate mental health problems.
3. Your relationships. By understanding your emotions and how to control them,
you're better able to express how you feel and understand how others are feeling.
This allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships,
both at work and in your personal life.
4. Your social intelligence. Being in tune with your emotions serves a social purpose,
connecting you to other people and the world around you. Social intelligence
enables you to reduce stress and balance your nervous system through social
communication, and connection with others.
Knowledge of emotional intelligence and the ability to positively act on it are not the same. It's
important to remember that there is a difference between having knowledge and consciously
applying that knowledge to your life. Even though you know, being stressed and overwhelmed
can override your ability to act on your knowledge. In order to consistently engage your
awareness in ways that stand up under pressure, you can develop or enhance the skills to
overcome stress in the moment.
By enhancing emotional intelligence, each educator can become more productive and
successful at what they do, and help students become more productive and successful too!
The way teachers shape and handle their own feelings and
those of their learners is central to the success of learning.

Self-Care Activities
Because every person’s schedule and speciﬁc needs are different, practicing self-care can look
different for everyone. A list of self-care activities for teachers could include the following
ideas:
-Take a 10-20 minute break each day for just yourself
-Provide positive affrmations to increase conﬁdence and improve self-image
-Bring a self-care "emergency pack" to school with things you enjoy so you can destress during your break if needed
-Use journals or writing to help recognize and process emotions
-Take a 20-30 minute walk or participate in other physical activities
-Apply mindfulness strategies, such as meditation
-Utilize social support from colleagues, friends, family, and signiﬁcant others

Developing positive relationships with colleagues can also be rewarding. Teachers who report
positive connections with their colleagues have a sense of belonging and shared commitment.
In addition, according to Greater Good in Education (2022), teachers with strong connections:
say that their colleagues respect and trust each other
see their coworkers as accepting and encouraging, as well as
collaborative and supportive of each other’s success
feel that they can communicate openly with colleagues and go to them

Practicing self-care, being consciously aware of your
emotions, and building strong relationships are effective
ways you can promote your own wellness. Lastly and
arguably most importantly, you have to set boundaries.
Here are some tips from ResilientEducator.com:
Set Boundaries to Protect Your Peace
The time has come to put yourself ﬁrst. Teaching is a calling of the heart, but your
physical and mental wellbeing shouldn’t have to suffer to follow your passion. But
creating boundaries can be very hard. Here are just a few "doable" tips to assist with
creating boundaries.
Tip 1 Stick to a ffnite grading time.
It’s easy to lose hours to schoolwork, but too much time spent grading can lead to
burnout faster for you and less quality feedback for your students. Your mind gets
tired and you can become agitated. Feedback is important but, if it’s not quality,
there’s no point in getting it back quickly. Block out a couple of hours to work. And do
your work. However, when the time is up, wrap it up. Stick to that time frame.
On those rare nights when you ﬁnd yourself with less work to do, get ahead. Put
together those lesson plans for next week, or the week after. Stay on track and stay
consistent, but stay within a time limit.
Tip 2 Schedule student help hours
Determine a set schedule and encourage your students to come to you during those
times for help or questions.
Post the times you are free during the day and available after school to provide
support and guidance to your students. Let parents know that this is a good time for
phone calls or emails with a letter home and post on your school’s website.
Scheduling speciﬁc times in advance will ease the mind of your students and parents
while encouraging them to seek out your help.
Tip 3 Take non-negotiable breaks
Find time for yourself in your day and protect that like a mama bear guarding her
cubs.
A break will help you tackle the rest of the day.
Make your lunch adults-only
Choose one of your planning periods to be alone
Close your classroom door, go to the break room, or take a walk
It is important to do whatever is going to give you a break from the hectic nature of
the day. Some of these options may not be feasible everywhere; that’s totally okay!
What is important is to ﬁnd some time with yourself, or with other adults, in whatever
way works for you.


Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- Wellness refers to the health and wellbeing of everyone involved in the school
setting. Beyond the absence of health and other disorders or challenges, wellness
involves proactively thriving in your environment
- Prioritizing wellness makes educators more likely to stay in the profession,
increases quality of life, and, ultimately, makes a stronger school system
- Educators face many challenges in achieving wellness, and many strategies at the
leadership/policy level and at the individual level can help promote wellness
- Wellness strategies at the leadership level include regularly seeking and using
feedback from educators through surveys and/or focus groups, integrating
wellness activities, such as meditation, and using a tiered approach
- Wellness strategies at the individual level include using emotional intelligence
skills, engaging in self-care activities, and building strong relationships

Supporting Student Wellness
Improving Wellness for All
Like the adults in the building, children coming to school also need to have their wellness
attended to.
To promote student wellness, schools, districts, and educational professionals must ﬁrst
recognize that there are many factors that impact a student’s academic attainment.
A healthy and supportive school environment helps children and adolescents develop the skills
they need to recognize and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, appreciate the
perspectives of others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible
decisions (CDC, Healthy Schools 2022).
School districts can help create a healthier generation by taking steps to promote proper
nutrition, physical health, and mental health.
Schools offer an important setting to educate students on the importance of a healthy mind
and body as part of the total learning experience and to encourage healthy behaviors that last
a lifetime.

Components of Student Wellness
Before looking at what schools can do to promote wellness in detail, let's examine the different
components of student wellness. Some of these components may be similar to the eight
dimensions of educator wellness discussed in the "Educator Wellness" lesson.
The Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child Model, WSCC, is a framework for
addressing wellness in schools that describes ten components for supporting student wellness.
The WSCC model is student-centered and emphasizes the role of the community in supporting
the school, the connections between health and academic achievement, and the importance of
evidence-based school policies and practices. The ten components include:
1. Family Engagement: Family engagement is critical to student success and wellbeing. For more information on family
engagement, review our "Elevating Family and Student Engagement" lessons!
2. Community Involvement: Communities and schools can work together to promote wellness for students. Community organizations,
such as volunteer groups, libraries, local businesses, and others, can partner with schools for initiatives
and activities that enhance the strength of the community and support student wellness.
3. Employee Wellness: The wellness of educators and other school staff is essential for creating a healthy environment. Educators
who are well can serve as role models for students, are more likely to find satisfaction with and stay in the
profession and enhance the quality of education that students receive. For more information on employee
wellness, review Part 1 of this lesson!
4. Counseling, Psychological, and Social Services: It is essential for schools to promote access to counseling, psychological, and social services in order for all students to thrive. Students and educators may need assessments, treatment, or interventions, and
providing access to these services helps promote wellbeing for all.
5. Health Services: Similar to counseling, psychological, and social services, providing access to health services is essential in
promoting wellbeing for all. Prevention and intervention for medical concerns, intervention in emergency
situations, and other services help improve wellbeing.
6. Physical Environment: The physical environment of the school can make a big difference in the sense of safety and comfort that
students and educators feel. A comfortable and safe environment enhances mental health and wellbeing.
7. Social and Emotional Climate: The climate of a school is essential in promoting and supporting wellbeing. Positive school cultures
promote wellness, increase feelings of connectedness in the community, and improve mental health. For
more information on creating positive school climates, review our "School Climate and Safety
Enhancement" lesson.
8. Health Education: Health education is essential to provide students to foster their independence and help them make
informed and healthy decisions. High-quality health education empowers students to build healthy habits
that last for a lifetime.
9. Nutrition Environment and Services: Nutrition is another component of overall health and wellbeing. Nutrition services in a school can include
providing healthy meals, providing education about nutrition, and building a positive culture that
promotes healthy nutrition choices.
10. Physical Education and Physical Activity: Physical education and physical activity are also huge contributors to student wellness. Providing access to physical education, recess, and sports teams can promote a lifelong love of physical activity that supports
health and wellness.

Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child
(WSCC)
The Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child, or WSCC model, is CDC's
framework for addressing health in schools. The WSCC model is student-
centered and emphasizes the role of the community in supporting the school,
the connections between health and academic achievement and the importance
of evidence-based school policies and practices.

Physical Health and Wellbeing
Strategies for Promoting Healthy Habits for Student Wellness
Physical health is critical to the wellness of students in the school building. Physical health can
be addressed through the components of WSCC involving nutrition, physical activity, health
services, and health education. In this section, we will review how to address these wellness
components and provide resources for school implementation.
“A healthy outside starts from the inside.”
- Robert Urich -
Nutrition
Cartoon image of students in school lunch cafeteria
In 1946, the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) was created by Congress in the National
School Lunch Act. In the Act, Congress declared the program a "measure of National Security to
safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children."
Nutrition was and continues to be an important focus for schools because it is one of the
bedrocks of students' physical and mental wellness and academic engagement.
Getting healthy meals and snacks helps students show up ready to learn!
"Every student has the potential to do well in school.
Failing to provide good nutrition puts them at risk of
missing out on meeting that potential. However, taking
action today to provide healthier choices in schools can
help to set students up for a successful future full of
possibilities."-David Just, PhD, Cornell Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs

Food Insecurity
Federal and state policies regarding nutrition standards for schools are in place. Food assistance
programs help reimburse school meals for children of low-income families, such as the School
Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), National School Lunch
Program, and Summer Food Service Program. Providing nutritious meals and snacks can help
students retain the information they learned during the school day.
IMAGE HERE
Image of an arrow depicting the degrees of food insecurity; adult and child ﬁgures at
each degree.
But even with these programs in place, many students do not qualify for
food assistance programs, even though they live in households that have
trouble affording nutritious food.
Food insecurity is the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally
adequate and safe foods, or the limited or uncertain ability to acquire
acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways. More than one quarter of
families with food insecurity are not eligible for federal aid, leaving
them with few options for healthy food.
Research by Tufts University School of Nutrition and numerous other studies over the past
decades show that hungry children do not learn effectively and that even mild malnutrition can
impair physical and cognitive growth.
In addition to negative cognitive effects, hunger often results in emotional and social
diffculties. It is quite simple: the negative effects of childhood food insecurity translate to more
frequent illnesses, behavior issues, and poor academics. Access to healthy nutritious meals
positively affects children’s health and learning. Once children reach school age, they spend
more of their waking hours in school than in any other environment. This makes schools
essential to helping students meet their nutritional needs.
"All children should have a healthy meal. If children eat, they
learn better.""-Katrina Shealy, South Carolina Senator

Nutrition Education
Along with providing healthy nutritious meals for all students, schools can make nutrition
education part of universal practices. Students can learn good eating habits in school just like
they learn other academic skills.
Scroll through the carousel below to review steps
schools can take to promote nutrition awareness and
healthier behaviors.
Nutrition Awareness
IMAGE HERE
Providing information about nutrition empowers children with the knowledge and
skills to make healthy food and beverage choices. Nutrition awareness is part of a
well-rounded health education curriculum but can also be included in other classes
and incorporated throughout the school. Schools can tailor nutrition programs for
their environment, daily schedules, and available resources.
Strategy 1:
In the classroom
Nutrition education can happen as a speciﬁcally focused course or lesson in the
classroom, but it can also be incorporated into everyday lessons. Some examples of
this include:
counting with pictures of fruits and vegetables
learning fractions by measuring ingredients for a recipe
examining how plants grow
learning about cultural food traditions
Strategy 2:
Farm-to-school
Farm-to-school programs vary in each school or district, but often include one or
more of the following strategies:
purchasing and serving local or regionally produced foods in the school meal
programs
educating students about agriculture, food, health, and nutrition
engaging students in hands-on learning opportunities through gardening,
cooking lessons, or farm ﬁeld trips
Students who participate in farm-to-school activities increase their knowledge about
nutrition and agriculture, are more willing to try new foods, and consume more fruits
and vegetables. Click here for information on South Carolina Farm-to-School
resources.
Strategy 3:
Plant a school garden
School gardens can provide with students hands-on experience and enhance their
education in many ways.
Students can prepare the soil for the garden, plant seeds, harvest fruits and
vegetables, and taste the food from the garden. Produce from school gardens can be
incorporated into school meals or taste tests. Classroom teachers can teach lessons in
math, science, history, and language arts using the school garden. Click here for a
school garden fact sheet.
Strategy 4
In the cafeteria
Cafeterias are where students eat, so it is important to utilize them to promote
healthy choices. Schools can offer healthy choices in the cafeteria, use signs and
decorations to promote nutrition education, and build a positive culture around
eating.
The Smart Snacks in Schoolnutrition standards support better health for our kids and
echo the good work already taking place in schools across the country.
Other Opportunities:
Nutrition education can also be incorporated outside of the cafeteria and mealtimes.
Positive messages about nutrition can be provided through:
morning announcements
school assemblies
materials sent home to parents and guardians
staff meetings
parent-teacher group meetings
These strategies can help reinforce messages about good nutrition and help ensure
that students see and hear consistent information about healthy eating across the
school campus and at home.

Physical Activity
Like good nutrition, physical activity can have a positive impact on academic performance.
Physical wellnessis a person's ability to learn and model healthy practices and routines. It is
being able to care for your body by consistently making healthy choices.
When a person is physically well, they exhibit:
attentiveness and alertness
positive interpersonal relationships
increased engagement
Review the image below for more information on the beneffts of physical activity.
IMAGE HERE
Infographic of statistics promoting the role of schools in physical activity
The American Pediatric Associate recommends that elementary and middle school students get
at least 60 minutes of physical activity most days, including vigorous activities (such as
swimming, running, or other high-intensity exercises) three days a week.
It is also very important for students to be educated about physical wellbeing not only to
maintain or improve their health but to create behaviors that will last into adulthood.
Physical Activity Challenges
The beneﬁts of physical activity are clear, but sometimes it can still be challenging to promote
or participate in physical activities. Unlike a few decades ago, children and adolescents today are
leading increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Time spent on computers, smart phones, tablets and
binge-watching television have often taken the place of physical exercise.
Health conditions, such as abnormal blood sugar and high cholesterol, were once rare in
children. But in a recent study, about two-thirds of American high school students already had
at least one of those conditions (National Institute of Health, 2022).
Also, lack of physical activity, especially in young people, has the potential to exacerbate existing
health disparities affecting socially vulnerable populations (Berkley Public Health, 2022). 
Regular physical activity can help improve cardiorespiratory ﬁtness, build strong bones and
muscles, control weight, reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, and reduce the risk of
developing health conditions such as:
heart disease
cancer
type 2 diabetes
high blood pressure
osteoporosis
obesity 

Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the United States, putting children and
adolescents at risk for poor health. Obesity prevalence among children and adolescents is
too high. Children with obesity are more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression, and low
self-esteem.
The Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) (2021) reported that for children and
adolescents aged 2-19 years in 2017-2020:
The prevalence of obesity was 19.7% and affected about 14.7 million children and
adolescents
Obesity prevalence was 12.7% among 2- to 5-year-olds, 20.7% among 6- to 11-
year-olds, and 22.2% among 12- to 19-year-olds
Obesity-related conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2
diabetes, breathing problems such as asthma and sleep apnea, and joint problems
By increasing students’ physical activity and physical
education, schools can help reduce the prevalence of
these conditions and signiffcantly improve academic
achievement and classroom behavior.Review the PDF

Brain Breaks
Taking "brain breaks" and being physically active in the classroom can help reset our minds
and bodies when we’re feeling unfocused and allow us to get back to work. Try allowing
students to take a moment to do some jumping jacks, go for a quick walk, or stand and do
breathing exercises. Giving individuals or groups of students an opportunity to take a brain
break during the school day can replenish attention, motivation, and energy levels needed to
keep learning. 5 minutes is all it takes!

Coordinated Approach to Child Health (CATCH)
The Coordinated Approach to Child Health,CATCH, promotes physical activity and healthy food
choices for children from preschool through eighth grade.
The program also includes the CATCH Coordination Kit which provides a step-by-step guide for
increasing collaboration between school administrators, teachers, nutrition staff, parents, and
community constituents to deliver coordinated health messages across children's learning
environments and afterschool settings.

The Alliance for a Healthier Generation
The Alliance for a Healthier Generation works with schools, youth-serving organizations,
businesses, and communities to support kids in developing lifelong healthy habits by ensuring
the environments that surround them provide and promote good health. The organization
developed the Healthy Schools Programwhich provides no-cost wellness supports for school
districts across the country. Watch this short video from the Alliance that perfectly sums up the
big picture of why nutrition and physical health are so important to overall wellness.


Mental Health and Wellness
Improving Wellness for Social and Emotional Health
We can all agree that nutrition and physical health are vital wellness factors in a student’s ability
to learn. Healthy children learn better (Basch, 2010). 
Another critical component of wellness is a child’s mental health–social, emotional, and
behavioral wellbeing is vital for their ability to engage, self-regulate, problem solve, and learn.
We recognize that mental health is equally as important as nutrition and physical health, and
that these inﬂuence each other. Unfortunately, when a student seems sad or irritable, not
interested in the activities they used to enjoy, many adults may tend to think of it as a typical
phase—that the student will “get over it” eventually. Although most children and adolescents
do experience bad days from time to time, sometimes there could be more to the story.
If you took the “All Hands on Deck” course, you learned that mental health can affect physical
health and behavior and untreated mental health challenges interfere with learning,
socialization, and self-esteem. This can lead to other problems with lifelong repercussions. For
some children, untreated mental health problems can lead to harming others or self-harm.
The current climate suggests the immediate need to enhance (expedite) and prioritize students'
positive mental health and wellness with more effective universal practices and intervention
strategies for all students embedded into the learning culture. We must treat wellness as a
school subject that is just as important as reading and math!

Youth Mental Health Challenges
In the fall of 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics along with the American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Children’s Hospital Association declared a national
emergency in child and adolescent mental health. This worsening mental health crisis is
undeniably tied to stress brought on by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with
the ongoing, seemingly daily, prevalence of social violence and struggles for justice, equity, and
inclusion—trends were observed to be accelerating prior to 2020. Not surprisingly, children and
adolescents are stressed out!
"The ﬁrst step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist.""- Zig Ziglar

Student Stressors
Aligning support with student needs within the tiered approach of the MTSS framework
promotes personalization, targeted intervention, effcient resource allocation, preventive and
early intervention, student engagement, and a positive school climate. By understanding and
responding to the unique needs of students, educators can provide the right support at the right
time, maximizing student success and well-being. Let's review some of the common stressors
that students might have on their minds.
- School demands: school itself is a stressor for 83% of teens (APA, 2017). This
involves school exams, preparing to apply to college, pressure to succeed, and
more.
- Negative self-image: students may struggle with their body image, especially as
they are in late childhood and early adolescence, a major transitional period
accompanied by body-related changes. These concerns can increase the risk of
developing mental health concerns, like depression, anxiety, and eating disorders
- Social issues: Making and maintaining friendships can also be challenging.
Bullying, peer pressure, and negative relationships can damage students' self-
esteem and lead to isolation.
- Environmental Stressors: students experience stressors in their home
environments as well. Students may experience stressors from family ﬁnances,
changes (like moving, divorce, or starting a new school), living with chronically ill
or mentally ill family members, diffculties with siblings or other family members,
grief from the loss of people close to them, and many other situations.
The typical challenges that students face in high school continue as they always have, but it is
evident that stressors have grown more complicated. While some students can handle high-
pressure school environments, others report feeling chronically stressed, overworked, and
sleep deprived. 

Types of Stress
As you can see from the section above, there are diverse stressors that students may experience.
Stress can be further categorized into three different categories: positive stress, tolerable stress,
and toxic stress.
- Positive stress: While "stress" sounds scary, a low level of stress is normal - this is
called positive stress. Positive stress results in temporary activation of the body's
stress response system, causing increases in heart rate and stress hormones. For
example, a student might be nervous before their ﬁrst day of school and experience
"butterﬂies" in their stomach before they go into the classroom.
- Tolerable stress: This is the next level of stress. Tolerable stress results from
stressful, impactful events, such as the death of a loved one, natural disasters, or
injuries. This level of stress may activate the stress response system for a short
period of time, but the body goes back to "normal" and recovers, especially with the
support of relationships and other healthy coping mechanisms.
- Toxic stress: This type of stress involves intense, prolonged activation of the stress
response system and can lead to long-lasting "wear-and-tear" on the body and
brain.Toxic stress experienced in childhood (ages 0–17 years) is referred to as
adverse childhood experiences or ACEs. These experiences are very common: nearly
two-thirds of adults report having experienced at least one ACE during childhood
(CDC, 2023).ACEs have been linked to chronic health problems, mental illness, and
substance abuse as children grow to become adults. ACEs can also negatively impact
education and job opportunities, but, fortunately, with the right support and
positive relationships, students can recover from ACEs.
To review common ACEs, view the chart below. Click to

Mental Health Concerns
Many of our teens continue to experience a decline in mental health
—rising anxiety, depression, withdrawal, aggression, resulting in
poor coping skills such as drug and/or alcohol use and suicidal
ideation.
According to a 2019 Pew Research Poll, 70% of teens surveyed agree
that anxiety and depression are major problems among peers. Click
to enlarge the image for more of the poll details.
IMAGE HERE
Graph indicating % of teens reporting major problems. Categories include anxiety &
depression, bullying, drug addiction, drinking alcohol, and poverty.
Some teens experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety are simply without the
necessary support and resources to cope. Emergency room visits for self-infficted,
nonfatal injuries among children and young adults increased by 5.7% from 2008 to
2015. The CDC found that between 2007 and 2017, more teens were seriously
considering suicide or hurting themselves in suicide attempts than in past decades.
To learn about suicide preventionclick here.
Teens report that they don't speak up about their mental health because they feel like adults will
just take over the conversation. Teens often won't tune into suggestions or advice because they
feel they are just being told what to do, rather than being trusted and treated as capable. And
they often don't feel their frustrations are being treated as valid — not feeling heard, seen, or
understood. Many teens report often feeling like their mental health is not taken seriously by
adults at home or at school. 
Scroll through the carousel below to read some
comments made by teenagers.
“I feel like the warning signs I gave off when I was younger, to me it felt like it
was so noticeable. I was always angry. I felt like every single day was a bad day. I
felt like nobody wanted to help me. There’s something wrong. How could you
not see it?”
- Katie, a teenager speaking about her mental health and not being seen
“Mental health is not taken seriously at all. At my school, we only have one
counselor for 8-12th grade students. That is crazy because we have 800-900
students and for all those students there is only one counselor. Schools don’t
take time to talk to students about mental health and how to take care of it.”
- unknown high school student
“I was always afraid that they[adults] were going to say it’s stupid or it’s dumb
that you feel that way, about being depressed, [like] ‘That’s not a reason to get
depressed’ and I didn’t want them to say stuff about things I felt because I
didn’t want to feel stupid.”
- 15 year old in a focus group
“A lot of the time it feels like no one is really listening to me. It feels like they
listen to my parents, but they’re not paying attention to me … That’s why I don’t
want to help.”
- 15 year old (previously treated for mental illness)
The above quotes are just a few examples of the ongoing communication problems that teens
perceive and that inﬂuence how and if they will seek help for themselves or help for others.
Mental Illness in Early Childhood
While teens have high rates of mental health concerns, and many mental health concerns
increase in adolescence, students also face mental health challenges at an earlier age, often at
the elementary school level (e.g., McClure, 2009).
According to a study done by the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard University in 2019,
around 10% of children ages 2 to 5 showed signs of an anxiety disorder. 17.4% or 1 in 6 U.S.
children aged 2–8 years had a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder.
In fact, anxiety is one the most prevalent childhood mental health problems (Krain et al., 2007).
Anxiety may present in young children as fear or worry but can also make children irritable and
angry (CDC, 2022). This can create behavioral issues in school and in the classroom. Be aware,
however, that some anxious children keep their worries to themselves, and their symptoms can
be missed.
Elementary school students can be stressed about some of the same issues as middle and high
schoolers, such as struggles with academics, not having enough friends, being bullied, and
exposure to major societal issues that they are not developmentally able to understand. They
may express their stress a little differently with behaviors such as more outbursts, crying,
complaining more than usual about aches and pains, displaying surprising fearful reactions, or
excessive clinging to a parent or teacher.
…young people are faced with all kinds of challenges
on a daily basis. They may be homeless. They’re
dealing with issues of domestic violence, and
community violence. Some of them may not have
food to eat on a regular basis...they don’t leave those
issues at the door, they take those issues into the
school building and ultimately into the classroom.”

Strategies for Supporting Youth Mental Health
Improving Emotional Wellness at the Tier 1 Level
Knowing all the challenges to mental health and wellbeing that students experience, it is
important to have a plan in place for how to support them. Utilizing the MTSS framework and
Tier 1 support can help organize these supports.
From the ﬁrst lesson in this Tier 1 series, "Universal Supports," you know that Tier 1 is the
largest tier and the foundation for the MTSS framework. Tier 1 encompasses the entire school
community with core instruction that integrates wellness activities for all students, families,
educators, and staff to participate.
Your district may have already begun utilizing an MTSS that focuses on the academic and
behavioral needs of students. Many school districts have. Even though academic success and
student behavior are both inﬂuenced by the state of a student's mental health and wellness,
integrating mental health support continues to be a challenge for some school districts. To
prioritize and enhance student wellness, mental health practices, and interventions must be
built into the MTSS.
No matter whether your district has a current MTSS or is still in the installation process, it can
seem diffcult or overwhelming to be charged with the task of integrating mental health
practices. But it is not as hard as you think. In fact, you are already doing the work. Most
educators are already doing so many things that are considered universal (Tier 1) mental health
practices. Here is Brandi Simonsen again, discussing ways that educators may already be
implementing Tier 1 practices in the classroom.
Your district may have already begun utilizing an MTSS that focuses on the academic and
behavioral needs of students. Many school districts have. However, integrating mental health
support continues to be a challenge for some school districts, even though it is clear that
academic success and student behavior are both inﬂuenced by the state of a student's mental
health and wellness. To prioritize and enhance student wellness, mental health practices, and
interventions must be built into the MTSS.
In the following sections, we will review strategies for improving wellness, including:
Trauma-sensitive practices
Universal screening
Mental health literacy
Positive educator-student relationships

- Trauma-sensitive Practices: A trauma-sensitive school describes a school in which all students feel safe, welcomed, and
supported and where addressing trauma's impact on learning is schoolwide and at the center of
its educational mission.
“Every year, there are a few students in my 6th grade class I just can’t reach no
matter what I try...
After learning about trauma’s impact at school, their behaviors began to make
sense to me.
Now I focus on making routines predictable and try to be more conscious of the
tone of voice I use with all my students.
But I’m only one teacher in my students’ day. I know that for students to truly
feel safe, trauma sensitive approaches must be infused throughout the entire
building. How do I get this started at my school?
I can see that it will take all of us.”
- Educator, NEA.com
Trauma-Sensitive Practices
Learning about the impacts of trauma can help keep educators from misunderstanding the
reasons underlying some children’s diffculties with learning, behavior, and relationships.
Once schools understand the educational impacts of trauma, trauma sensitivity can become
a regular part of how the school is run. School becomes a safe supportive environment where
students feel connected and conﬁdent to learn and succeed. Trauma sensitivity will look
different at each school. However, a shared deﬁnition of what it means to be a trauma-
sensitive school can bring educators, parents, and policymakers together around a common
vision.
Implementing trauma-informed practices in an MTSS supports students with adverse
childhood experiences and those who are experiencing mental health issues—social,
emotional, and behavioral problems. In a tiered system, support can be implemented at all
levels.
The training,Understanding Adverse Childhood Experiences from ACE Interface, Inc. is
nationally recognized as a powerful curriculum that helps individuals understand and
recognize adverse childhood experiences.
Resources for Creating a Trauma Sensitive School
The Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative (TLPI) was created in partnership between
Massachusetts Advocates for Children and Harvard Law School with the mission to ensure that
all students, including those impacted by trauma, succeed at their highest levels in school and
in life.
Helping Traumatized Children Learn, published in 2005, is TLPI’s landmark report and
summarizes research from psychology and neurobiology that documents the impact that
trauma from exposure to violence can have on children’s learning, behavior, and relationships
in school.
Volume 2 of Helping Traumatized Children Learn: Creating and Advocating for Trauma-
Sensitive Schools (2013) offers a process for creating trauma-sensitive schools and a policy
agenda to provide the support schools need to achieve this goal. The Guide is intended to be a
living document that will grow and change as more schools become trauma sensitive and add to
their ideas.
Download both documents using the link below.
TLPI Publications - Helping Traumatized Children Learn
Helping Traumatized Children Learn volumes 1 & 2 can help any school create a
safe and secure trauma sensitive learning environment to beneﬁt all children.
Also, the National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments developed the Building
Trauma-Sensitive Schools Training Package to introduce all school staff to the concept of
trauma sensitivity and provide examples of trauma-sensitive practices that can be adopted in
the classroom and schoolwide. Resources include an online module, downloadable handouts,
and a facilitation guide that includes suggestions for how to conduct in-person training
sessions using the module and handouts. The National Center on Safe Supportive Learning
Environments website content was assembled under contracts from the U.S. Department of
Education, Offce of Safe and Supportive Schools to the American Institutes for Research (AIR).
Universal Screening
Another way to support wellness at the Tier 1 level of MTSS is through universal screening. Let's
review the importance of universal systematic social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB)
screening, which was discussed in detail in the previous SBHA Core MTSS Practices course,
"Screening for Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Functioning."
Promoting social and emotional development for all students in classrooms involves identifying
those students struggling with mental health challenges that impact their full access to and
participation in learning. Some of the beneﬁts of universal SEB screening include:
- Universal SEB screening is accessible to all students in the classroom.
- School-based universal SEB health screening provides important information
about the emotional and behavioral health of students.
- Universal SEB screening is the ﬁrst step in helping to identify
students in need of additional supports.
- Universal SEB screening is associated with early identiﬁcation and treatment of
mental health and behavioral concerns.
- Data from universal SEB screeners gives districts and schools the ability to monitor
school trends and develop targeted social, emotional and behavioral health
strategies speciﬁc to the needs in each individual school building.
- Universal screening is recognized as an essential component of a multi-tiered
school behavioral health framework.
SEB screening data are valid indicators of student SEB competence and risk. Having this
information helps districts pinpoint areas of need and maximize opportunities for early
intervention and prevention before poor outcomes begin to transpire. Districts can aggregate
data and make informed decisions about prioritizing, setting goals, gathering relevant
resources, and taking action.

Mental Health Literacy
Another way to support universal wellness for students is to provide mental health literacy
programming. Lack of knowledge regarding mental health and the stigma associated with
mental illness are major barriers to the promotion of mental health and early intervention.
Addressing a youth mental health crisis requires understanding what mental health is: this is
where mental health literacy can be helpful. 
Evidence-based mental health literacyis a scientiﬁcally established effective foundation for all
mental health improvements. With good mental health literacy, we are empowered and provided
with the knowledge that we need to help us build better lives, better systems of care, and a better
society (Wei & Kutcher 2018).
School-wide mental health literacy has four unique, yet integrated components:
- Understanding mental health and how to maintain good mental health
- Understanding mental disorders and their treatments
- Decreasing stigma
- Increasing health-seeking effcacy
Schoolwide programs and presentations and the regular distribution of materials to increase
mental health literacy and reduce the stigma of mental illness are Tier 1 strategies. Topics can
include many subjects, such as suicide prevention, the effects of trauma and adverse childhood
experiences (ACES), recognizing the signs of depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and improving
family relationships and self-regulation skills. Also, educators can help guide students toward
language free of mental health stigma by helping them identify and replace stigmatizing
language in the classroom.

Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide
The Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide is one resource that has been developed
to help enhance the mental health literacy of students and is targeted to be used in 9th and 10th
grade (ages 13 to 15 years). This is the time of the lifespan in which the diagnoses of mental
disorders begin to increase dramatically; it is thus essential that young people be able to have
the knowledge, attitudes, and competencies to help themselves and others if necessary.
Download the resource below for a curriculum guide to increasing mental health awareness.

Mental Health Literacy Website
Another resource online is mentalhealthliteracy.org. The faculties of education from St. Francis
Xavier University, Western University, and the University of British Columbia, partnered with
this project to build a comprehensive mental health literacy resource for educators. Follow the
link below to access these resources.
Mental Health Literacy
"With good mental health literacy, we learn how to take better care of
ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. We are empowered and
provided with the skills that we need to help us build better lives, better
systems of care and a better society."

National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)
The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has created Ending the Silence, a free,
evidence-based, 50-minute session designed for middle and high school students. This
engaging presentation helps students learn about the warning signs of mental health
conditions, facts and statistics about mental illness, and the steps to take if they or a loved one
are showing symptoms of a mental health condition.
This program is offered at no cost to schools and communities and is presented in person, but it
is also now available online when an in-person presentation is not available.
NAMI Ending the Silence presentations include two leaders: one who shares an informative
presentation and a young adult with a mental health condition who shares their journey of
recovery. Audience members can ask questions and gain understanding of an often-
misunderstood topic. Through dialogue, we can help grow the movement to end stigma.
NAMI also offers programming for staff and families:
NAMI Ending the Silence for School Staff (in person only): 1-hour presentation for school staff
members that includes information about warning signs, facts, statistics, how to approach
students, and how to work with families.
NAMI Ending the Silence for Families(in-person only): 1-hour presentation for adults with
middle- or high-school-aged youth that includes warning signs, facts, statistics, how to talk
with your child, and how to work with school staff.

youth group, click the button for more information.

Building Positive Educator-Student Relationships
One more way to promote universal wellness for students is to promote positive relationships.
Educators strive to engage students, promote the highest standards of academics, attend to the
needs of each learner, support each and every success, and genuinely care about the wellbeing
of each student.
Whether you are new to the school district or have been around for 20+ years, you know that
positive student-adult interactions encourage students' motivation and engagement in
learning. Watch this video from Edutopia giving a quick overview of the "power of relationships
in schools" and why this is one of the most important aspects of teaching.
The Power of Relationships in Schools
The Power of Relationships in Schools
Intentionally building positive student-educator relationships promotes trust and respect,
reduces stress, and serves as one of the most important overall drivers of student, educator, and
whole-school wellness. Scroll through the carousel to gain information about practices that can
be used to develop relationships and build positive school and classroom community.
Effective Relationship-Building Practices
Relationship-building practices are proven to be effective in supporting student
well-being in schools and classrooms. Here we highlight four examples:community
circles, relationship mapping, audit & reﬂect, and engagement & connectedness.
Example 1
Community Circles
A classroom practice that emphasizes predictable, structured open dialogues between
students and adults.
Community Circles allow educators to see each student as an individual. Each student
brings a unique story and perspective each day, enriching and enlivening the class
with their viewpoints.
One easy way to enhance the relationship between students and adults is to let them
know when you don’t see them there. For example, one high school English teacher
shared that she records a quick message with her students at the beginning of class
and sends it to those who are absent to let them know they were missed. 
Community Circles can be used with all grade levels.
Example 2
Trust and Safety through Relationship Mapping
When a student is more familiar with you, they feel comfortable and safe.
The relationship and trust that is built provides an opportunity to learn about the
student and techniques that may work best to help them.
Build relationships intentionally.
Relationship Mappingis an activity that connects one adult to every student in
school. Having a trusting and deep connection with students increases a sense of
belonging in the school community, reduces bullying, lowers drop-out rates, and
improves social and emotional capacities. This tool allows staff to inventory their
relationships and create an action plan to ensure all students feel a sense of
belonging.
Example 3
Audit & Reffect
You read all about school and classroom expectations in the previous lesson, but did
you include setting and meeting expectations for yourself? Take a moment to notice
the way that you interact with your students. If possible, watch a video of your own
teaching. 
Equity Audit and Reﬂection is a list of questions that allow teachers to reﬂect on
whether they use culturally responsive teaching in their classroom to ensure equity.
Some example questions include:
Are you giving students meaningful feedback that says you care about them and
their learning or are you constantly telling your students to hurry?
In your conversations, are you focusing on what your students have accomplished
or are you concentrating your comments on what they have not yet mastered?
Does your body language, facial expression, and tone of voice show your students
that you are interested in them as people too?
Are you telling them to do one thing, yet you model quite different behavior? For
example, are you telling your students to listen to each other, but then look bored
when one of them talks to the class?
Are you paying more attention to some students than to others?
Example 4
Engagement & Connectedness
How do educators create opportunities for full engagement for students in safe
learning environments? By ﬁnding ways to connect content and curriculum to the
everyday lives of students.
Promoting connectedness among all school community members is key to fostering
an open and positive dialogue and participation in various well-being activities:
celebrate resilience and acknowledge that fear and worry are normal human
reactions and each individual student, teacher or parent experiences them to
different degrees. 
set up networks where students and adults positively interact.
support members of the school community to express their feelings and
concerns;
dedicate time and space for this in your daily routine
Check out this resource for more info on school connectedness:
Summary
Improving students' relationships with teachers has important, positive and long-
lasting implications for both students' academic and social development.
Positive teacher-student relationships—evidenced by teachers' reports of low
conﬂict, a high degree of closeness and support, and little dependency—have been
shown to support students' adjustment to school, contribute to their social skills,
promote academic performance and foster students' resiliency in academic
performance (e.g., Battistich, Schaps, & Wilson, 2004). 
Additional Resources

Great work!
Let's review the lesson.
- A universal approach to wellness in schools means that everyone will have access to
positive health and wellbeing supports. These supports are appropriate for each
grade level and should be rigorously implemented to build and strengthen skills
that are part of the foundation for good mental health and resilience.
- All parts of the school, from the front door to the playground, offer opportunities to
practice and reinforce wellness. Wellness does not spontaneously grow in the
sidewalk cracks of time between class assignments and faculty meetings.
- Simply put, those who feel better can learn better.
Before you go!
